  abstract = {Atmospheric gravity waves have been a subject of intense research activity in recent years because of their myriad effects and their major contributions to atmospheric circulation, structure, and variability. Apart from occasionally strong lower-atmospheric effects, the major wave influences occur in the middle atmosphere, between ∼ 10 and 110 km altitudes because of decreasing density and increasing wave amplitudes with altitude. Theoretical, numerical, and observational studies have advanced our understanding of gravity waves on many fronts since the review by Fritts [1984a]; the present review will focus on these more recent contributions. Progress includes a better appreciation of gravity wave sources and characteristics, the evolution of the gravity wave spectrum with altitude and with variations of wind and stability, the character and implications of observed climatologies, and the wave interaction and instability processes that constrain wave amplitudes and spectral shape. Recent studies have also expanded dramatically our understanding of gravity wave influences on the large-scale circulation and the thermal and constituent structures of the middle atmosphere. These advances have led to a number of parameterizations of gravity wave effects which are enabling ever more realistic descriptions of gravity wave forcing in large-scale models. There remain, nevertheless, a number of areas in which further progress is needed in refining our understanding of and our ability to describe and predict gravity wave influences in the middle atmosphere. Our view of these unknowns and needs is also offered.},

@article{Clausen2011,
   abstract = {We identified 1875 wave events in magnetic field data from geosynchronous orbit. Most of these events were transverse with respect to the background magnetic field, left-hand polarized, and were observed in the post-noon magnetic local time sector at frequencies just below the helium gyrofrequency. Combined, these observations strongly suggest that most of these events are Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves. Average wave amplitudes are presented, binned by frequency, geomagnetic activity and magnetic local time. The amplitude increases with increasing geomagnetic activity; increased activity also narrows the local time sector in which the waves are observed. A superposed epoch analysis of solar wind parameters and geomagnetic activity indices shows that 12 hours before wave onset the AE and Kp index increased, indicating storm and substorm activity that injects hot ion populations needed to drive the EMIC instability and providing ample time for those populations to drift into the post-noon local time sector. Just before wave onset a sudden enhancement in the AE index and the solar wind dynamic pressure are observed, indicating that a final perturbation of the magnetosphere is needed to excite EMIC wave growth. EMIC waves are thought to cause loss of relativistic particles in the radiation belt. Large solar wind densities have been associated with low flux of relativistic particles during the recovery phase of geomagnetic storms. We show that EMIC waves are preferentially generated during intervals of large solar wind density, indicating that such conditions drive EMIC waves which in turn cause enhanced loss of relativistic particles.},

   abstract = {Using the method of Thomson scatter, it has been possible to observe detailed ionospheric effects due to solar flares. Observations have been limited to four 2B flares, and two of these events have been examined intensively. The two events that have been studied exhibit very similar characteristics, i.e., a strong and long-lasting E-region electron density enhancement, a moderate and shorter duration F1-region enhancement, and a moderate F2-region enhancement characterized by a long-duration `tail.'Flare X-ray data, available in the 2- to 12-angstrom band, shows excellent agreement with electron density fluctuations in the lower E region. The F1-region enhancement is believed to follow the time history of the EUV ionizing radiations. The F2-region tail is attributed to the much smaller recombination rate at these heights. Plasma-line observations, permitting unequivocal measurement of electron density, have been possible within a limited height range. Comparison of electron density, as deduced from the plasma lines, with backscattered power measurements corrected for the effects of absorption, has resulted in estimates of flare-associated changes in the ratio of electron to ion temperature.},

Some of these, such as phase and packet velocities and phase trace speeds, are well known and widely applied. Others are less well known and less widely applied, but nevertheless may be the observationally relevant ones on occasion. Virtually all have been subjected to some form of misunderstanding at one time or another. This paper seeks to recapitulate some of the more important properties and implications in a tutorial vein, both formally and with reference to the reduction of observational data. It illustrates many of its points in application to atmospheric acoustic-gravity waves, and goes on to remove two of the three observational objections that have been raised against such waves as the agency that produces TID's. The third objection is examined critically in a companion paper.},

   abstract = {Pi2 pulsations have been the subject of continuous study since they were recognized to be an integral part of the magnetospheric substorm. With the advent of arrays of ground instruments the nature of the Pi2 has begun to be understood. As adopted by the 13th General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics in 1963, Pi2 is a designation that includes impulsive pulsations in the period range from 40 to 150 s. The Pi2 signal encompasses a class of pulsations that represents two fundamental processes. The first process is the sudden generation of field-aligned currents in association with the disruption of cross-tail currents in the plasma sheet and their subsequent effects on the ionosphere. The ionosphere appears to be something more than a passive load for this electrodynamic impulse. It responds, sending currents back into a magnetosphere whose topology is changing and, perhaps producing the feedback necessary to cause the explosive growth of the substorm current system. Oscillations of these currents are detected across the nightside of the Earth at onset as the midlatitude and high-latitude portions of Pi2. The second process is the impulse response of the inner magnetosphere to the compressional waves that are generated at substorm onset. Traveling inward, they stimulate field line resonances and surface waves at the plasmapause and excite global oscillations in the inner magnetosphere. The two processes produce wave modes that couple and cross-couple threading energy into the inner magnetosphere and ultimately to the ground. The purpose of this review is to construct a phenomenological overview of the Pi2.},

   abstract = {We surveyed 10 years of CANOPUS Churchill line magnetometer data for Pc5 pulsations and catalogued over 4500 hours of pulsation activity (3334 Pc5 pulsation intervals). Many previously observed Pc5 pulsation characteristics are evident in our data including the dawn/dusk occurrence asymmetry, antisunward propagation patterns, strong correlations between Pc5 band power spectral density (PSD) and solar wind flow speed, increased Pc5 pulsation occurrence during times of high solar wind speeds, and statistical evidence for Pc5 pulsation polarization sense reversals in latitude and local time (across local noon). Our investigation also revealed some as of yet unreported results such as a good correlation between solar wind speed/Pc5 band PSD in all MLT sectors, increased Pc5 pulsation occurrence with IMF Bz northward conditions (for all MLTs), and the prevalence of Pc5 pulsations under all Pc5 band relative power values. We used a subset of 800 data intervals which contained Pc5 pulsations in at least three Churchill line stations to search for pulsations that exhibit classic FLR characteristics. Four hundred and fifty of these pulsations matched the FLR criteria and we discovered that the FLR MLT occurrence distribution is asymmetric about local noon with more pulsations occurring in the morning sector (0600\&\{\#\}8211;1200 MLT) than the afternoon sector (1200\&\{\#\}8211;1800 MLT), and an absence of FLRs at local noon. We also found that the MLT occurrence distribution for the remaining 350 \&\{\#\}8220;non-FLR\&\{\#\}8221; pulsations is symmetric about local noon and has a (nonzero) local minimum at noon. In contradiction with the results of some previous studies, we find no evidence of stable, recurring, discrete Pc5 pulsation frequencies in our data set. Instead, our statistics show a continuous distribution of central frequencies and a general lack of frequency stability throughout the course of individual Pc5 pulsation events.},

  abstract = {The ionosphere is a highly dynamic medium that exhibits weather disturbances at all latitudes, longitudes, and altitudes, and these disturbances can have detrimental effects on both military and civilian systems. In an effort to mitigate the adverse effects, we are developing a physics-based data assimilation model of the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere called the Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements (GAIM). GAIM will use a physics-based ionosphere-plasmasphere model and a Kalman filter as a basis for assimilating a diverse set of real-time (or near real-time) measurements. Some of the data to be assimilated include in situ density measurements from satellites, ionosonde electron density profiles, occultation data, ground-based GPS total electron contents (TECs), two-dimensional ionospheric density distributions from tomography chains, and line-of-sight UV emissions from selected satellites. When completed, GAIM will provide specifications and forecasts on a spatial grid that can be global, regional, or local. The primary output of GAIM will be a continuous reconstruction of the three-dimensional electron density distribution from 90 km to geosynchronous altitude (35,000 km). GAIM also outputs auxiliary parameters, including NmF2, hmF2, NmE, hmE, and slant and vertical TEC. Furthermore, GAIM provides global distributions for the ionospheric drivers (neutral winds and densities, magnetospheric and equatorial electric fields, and electron precipitation patterns). In its specification mode, GAIM yields quantitative estimates for the accuracy of the reconstructed ionospheric densities.},

@article{Chi2001,
   abstract = {It has been thought that the preliminary reverse impulse (PRI) of the sudden commencements (SC) phenomena occurs simultaneously on the ground at different locations. A popular explanation is that the PRI propagates through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide at the 35 ground magnetometer stations during the SC event on September 24, 1998, and found clear differences in the arrival time of PRI. We calculated the MHD wave propagation time from the location of the first compression of the magnetosphere to the low-latitude ground stations and found good agreement with the observed PRI arrival times. Our calculation also indicates that the wavefront is seriously distorted by the inhomogeneity of the magnetosphere and the small difference in PRI arrival time between high-latitude and low-latitude observations cannot be an indicator of a super-Alfvenic propagation. We also found implications that high-latitude PRIs can be induced by the vortex of ionospheric currents at nearby latitudes, and the motion of the current vortex can affect the arrival time of high-latitude PRIs.},

@article{Iijima1972,
   abstract = {The development of a polar substorm consists of two distinctly different phases; i.e. the growth phase lasting 1 or 2 hr prior to the well-defined breakup, and the subsequent expansion phase. The essential signatures for the growth phase are a gradual development of the polar vortex type current without remarkable current enhancement in the auroral belt (DP 2 field), and the asymmetric growth of the low latitude field-depression in the eveningmidnight-early morning sector (DRT field). After a distinct DP 2 and DRT fields, drastic changes occur in the substorm development and the expansion phase starts. The expansion phase is characterized by a rapid expansion of the auroral electrojet disturbance (AEJ or DP-B field) in the high latitudes, and a rapid recovery of the field-depression near the midnight meridian and the subsequent asymmetric development of the disturbance field in the low latitudes. Considering the close associations of the interplanetary magnetic disturbance field with the magnetospheric field and particle disturbances which have been confirmed by various authors, it may be concluded that the growth phase is the precursory excitation of the magnetospheric background and the energy-storage or the energy-conversion stage in the magnetosphere due to the non-equilibrium magnetospheric convection, while the expansion phase is the energy-diversion stage in the magnetosphere. The disturbance field in the growth phase is a nucleus-like, fundamental element for the substorm breakup and it is essentially different from the expansion phase disturbance in quality and in quantity.},

   abstract = {Abstract An examination of satellite-derived temperatures reveals that the winter polar stratopause is usually elevated and warmer than the adjacent midlatitude stratopause. This ?separated stratopause? occurs in both hemispheres, but is more pronounced and persistent in the southern winter. It descends with time towards spring and exhibits week to week variability. Observational diagnostics and results from a two dimensional (2-D) model suggest that gravity wave driving can account for this separated polar stratopause by driving a meridional circulation with downwelling over the winter pole. In the model, the solar heating pattern induces stronger winter westerlies than summer easterlies, which leads to a stronger gravity wave driven circulation in the winter hemisphere. Spherical geometry and the high latitude location of the winter westerly jet combine to yield a concentrated region of downwelling. Model results suggest that descent of the temperature maximum with time is probably caused by wave?mean flow interaction.},

Distributed over a very extensive range of geomagnetic latitudes (−62$\,^\{\circ\}$ to −87$\,^\{\circ\}$, spanning ∼2920 km geographically) approximately along a magnetic meridian, the array showed poleward propagation of the Pc 1 waves in the ionospheric waveguide. It is observed that attenuation factors are between ∼8 and 20 dB/1000 km and the polarization sense changes from left-hand to right-hand as the waves are ducted poleward. However, a complex polarization pattern (i.e., change in ellipticity and major axis angle) was seen on the ground, which might be attributed to the array being close to the wave injection region where the superposed effect of incident waves and ducted waves is dominant. A CHAMP satellite conjunction showed a transverse and nearly linearly polarized Pc 1 ULF wave at the altitude of the ducting layer (∼350 km) over a limited latitudinal extent (−53$\,^\{\circ\}$ to −61$\,^\{\circ\}$ ILAT). The polarization analysis performed using the ground data supports the idea that CHAMP detected the wave activity near the wave injection region. The observations are unique in that the ducted waves, seen over an array with unprecedented geomagnetic latitudinal range and positioning along a magnetic meridian (a condition that provides the most efficient ducting), have rarely been measured before.},

   abstract = {Observations of thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures obtained during a geomagnetic storm on 2 October 2013 from a network of six Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs) deployed in the Midwest United States are presented. Coincident with the commencement of the storm, the apparent horizontal wind is observed to surge westward and southward (toward the equator). Simultaneous to this surge in the apparent horizontal winds, an apparent downward wind of approximately 100 m/s lasting for 6 h is observed. The apparent neutral temperature is observed to increase by approximately 400 K over all of the sites. Observations from an all-sky imaging system operated at the Millstone Hill observatory indicate the presence of a stable auroral red (SAR) arc and diffuse red aurora during this time. We suggest that the large sustained apparent downward winds arise from contamination of the spectral profile of the nominal thermospheric 630.0 nm emission by 630.0 nm emission from a different (nonthermospheric) source. Modeling demonstrates that the effect of an additional population of 630.0 nm photons, with a distinct velocity and temperature distribution, introduces an apparent Doppler shift when the combined emissions from the two sources are analyzed as a single population. Thus, the apparent Doppler shifts should not be interpreted as the bulk motion of the thermosphere, calling into question results from previous FPI studies of midlatitude storm time thermospheric winds. One possible source of contamination could be fast O related to the infusion of low-energy O+ ions from the magnetosphere. The presence of low-energy O+ is supported by observations made by the Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron spectrometer instruments on the twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft, which show an influx of low-energy ions during this period. These results emphasize the importance of distributed networks of instruments in understanding the complex dynamics that occur in the upper atmosphere during disturbed conditions.},

They make long homogeneous data sets and are widely used for long-term and statistical studies in geomagnetism and solar-terrestrial physics. After a short description of the main features of transient geomagnetic activity a definition of the K index as a measure of the irregular activity is given with a summary of its basic characteristics. The derivation of K-derived planetary indices is described and discussed, and updated indications concerning their availability are presented. This short review provides users with the minimum required knowledge about these indices and may serve as an introduction to the Mayaud (1980) monograph.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the diurnal and seasonal statistics for the dynamics and anisotropy of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MS TIDs) in comparison with the dynamics of small-scale irregularities (SSIs), using data from an annual run of ETS 2 radio signal polarization, angle-of-arrival, and scintillation measurements at 136 MHz in Irkutsk, Russia (52$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 104$\,^\{\circ\}$E). In daytime, phase interference patterns have the form of traveling waves with the mean propagation direction ψ equal to 160$\,^\{\circ\}$ and rms of 68$\,^\{\circ\}$, and phase velocity of 133 $\pm$ 62 m/s. The mean value of ψ increases in a clockwise direction from southeastward to southward and opposite to the calculated direction of the neutral wind, with the spread not exceeding 10$\,^\{\circ\}$--30$\,^\{\circ\}$. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis of neutral wind-induced filtering of atmospheric gravity waves (AGW) and MS TIDs caused by them. It was found that at night, MS TIDs are characterized by a strong anisotropy; the direction of elongation (modulo 180$\,^\{\circ\}$) is, on average, 25$\,^\{\circ\}$ less than for SSIs. This difference can be explained by assuming that medium-scale phase disturbances detected at night are caused by magnetic-field-aligned irregularities located in the plasmasphere.},

Observations show GW momentum flux divergence 6 days prior to the SSW onset, producing an eastward forcing with peak values of ∼+145 $\pm$ 60ms−1d−1. As the SSW evolves, GW forcing turns westward, reaching a minimum of ∼−240 $\pm$ 70ms−1d−1∼+18 days after the SSW onset.

   abstract = {Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs) are wave-like ionospheric perturbations routinely observed by high frequency radars. We focus on a class of MSTIDs observed during the winter daytime at high and mid latitudes. The source of these MSTIDs remains uncertain, with the two primary candidates being space weather and lower atmospheric processes. We surveyed observations from four high latitude and six mid latitude SuperDARN radars in the North American sector from November through May of 2012 to 2015. The MSTIDs observed have horizontal wavelengths between ∼150 to 650 km and horizontal velocities between ∼75 to 325 m s−1. In local fall and winter seasons the majority of MSTIDs propagated equatorward, with bearings ranging from ∼125∘to 225∘geographic azimuth. No clear correlation with space weather activity as parameterized by AE and Sym-H could be identified. Rather, MSTID observations were found to have a strong correlation with polar vortex dynamics on two timescales. First, a seasonal timescale follows the annual development and decay of the polar vortex. Second, a shorter 2--4 week timescale again corresponds to synoptic polar vortex variability, including stratospheric warmings. Additionally, statistical analysis shows MSTIDs are more likely during periods of strong polar vortex. Direct comparison of the MSTID observations with stratospheric zonal winds suggests a wind filtering mechanism may be responsible for the strong correlation. Collectively, these observations suggest that polar atmospheric processes, rather than space weather activity, are primarily responsible for controlling the occurrence of high and mid latitude winter daytime MSTIDs.},

With the help of a one-dimensional model appropriate for the region of interest we show that the ionosonde data was consistent with a lower F region plasma that was moving upwards with only modest velocities in the morning hours and moving resolutely downwards in the afternoon hours. This motion agreed well with the local magnetometer data which revealed a weakened electrojet taking place in the morning hours while a full-blown counter-electrojet was present in the afternoon hours. We show that the unusual solar eclipse-induced electrodynamics resulted in a reduction in the Total Electron Content depletion not just at the magnetic equator but also, more markedly, in the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) zone, a further 10 degrees to the north. This latter point clearly shows that the eclipse led to a cut-off in the supply of plasma provided through the equatorial fountain, by altering a fundamental aspect of the equatorial electrodynamics.},

   abstract = {A perturbation treatment is used to determine the nature and magnitude of the effects of internal atmospheric gravity waves on the ambient rates of production, chemical loss, and motion of the ionization. The relative and absolute importance of these effects in the creation of ionospheric irregularities are assessed. This assessment yields several conclusions of particular interest. Firstly, in the F2-region the dominant effect of the gravity waves is that of imparting the motion of the neutral gas parallel to the magnetic field to the ionization through collisional interaction. Secondly, at heights at or below the height of the F1-ledge, chemical effects, in particular the effect of gravity waves on the rate of photoionization, are quite important. Thirdly, gravity waves affect the rate of photoionization at a given point by changing both the neutral gas number density and the ionizing radiation flux at that point, and this latter effect, hitherto ignored, is in some respects the more important of the two. Fourthly, as a result of the interplay of a number of factors, certain Fourier components of that portion of the gravity-wave spectrum permitted at ionospheric heights are more successful than others in creating observable disturbances. Finally, gravity waves creating neutral gas velocities of the order of 20 m sec−1 seem capable under the right conditions of creating TID's of the largest magnitudes observed.},

Traveling ionospheric disturbances have been identified by noting similar frequency fluctuations on the four transmission paths that have appropriate time delays and are in the appropriate order. Because of the wide separation of the paths, only large-scale disturbances moving at high speed could be detected. From 1600 hours of data (usually from 1600 to 0200 UT) between October 1960 and April 1961, nine traveling disturbances have been positively recognized. Velocities and spatial lengths are deduced in six of them, assuming that these disturbances travel at a constant speed. Velocities range from 1450 to approximately 2750 km/hr, and spatial lengths from 1300 to more than 2000 km. The direction of travel cannot be determined accurately, but for all it is from north to south. On four occasions sudden frequency changes, correlated with sudden changes in the earth's magnetic field, preceded the appearance of large-scale traveling disturbances. It is suggested that these disturbances may have been launched by the same event that gave rise to the sudden change in the earth's magnetic field.},

  abstract = {HF radio propagation was observed regularly during the night at frequencies above the classical Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) on the circuit from Fort Collins, Colorado, to Boston, Massachusetts, during 2003 (McNamara et al., 2006). This propagation was attributed to above-the-MUF propagation, in the sense of normal refraction by over-dense regions in the F2 layer of the ionosphere, following Wheeler (1966). Similar propagation was also observed on a regular basis on the Ottawa to Boston circuit, at an operating frequency of 7.335 MHz. We have reanalyzed the nighttime Ottawa to Boston propagation in conjunction with observations of foF2 recorded by the digisonde at Millstone Hill (near Boston). Normal propagation (via refraction) would be supported on this circuit only when foF2 exceeds the equivalent vertical frequency, which is ∼5.7 MHz. The actual propagation extends through the midnight to dawn period even when foF2 drops below 4 MHz, with signal powers decreasing from about −80 dBW to −110 dBW. We deduce that there are three possible modes of propagation that are, in order of appearance: (1) normal refraction when foF2 exceeds 5.7 MHz; (2) ``sporadic'' reflection from large scale irregularities (tens of kilometers) with plasma frequencies that exceed 5.7 MHz in a lower density background; and (3) a 2-hop ground side scatter mode with hop lengths greater than the 7.335 MHz skip distance. The second mechanism is the one discussed by Wheeler (1966).},

The gravity wave energy is shown to have a seasonal variation with peaks at the equinoxes; the largest peak is around the spring equinox. During the winter months and extending into the spring, there is both an enhancement in the downward propagating wave activity and a reduction in the amount of critical-level filtering of upward propagating mountain waves. The horizontal propagation directions of the gravity waves were determined using hodographs. It was found that there is a predisposition toward northward and westward propagating waves above Rothera. This is in agreement with previous observations of gravity wave momentum flux in the wintertime mesosphere over Rothera. These results are consistent with a scenario whereby the stratospheric gravity wavefield above Rothera is determined by a combination of wind flow over topography-generating waves from below, and sources such as the edge of the polar stratospheric vortex-generating waves from above, especially during winter and spring.},

   abstract = {The spatial structure of ultralow frequency (ULF) waves is usually, though not exclusively, estimated from ground-based magnetometer measurements. This paper compares ULF wave spatial structure obtained from coincident ground magnetometer and HF radar measurements and addresses the interpretation of Pc5 azimuthal wave numbers. ULF spatial structures estimated from magnetometer and radar data were quite different for the October 23, 1994, event presented by Ziesolleck et al. \{$[$\}1998\{$]$\}. Azimuthal wave numbers (m) were 3\&\{\#\}8211;5 and 12 for the ground and ionosphere, respectively. We reexamine this event and attempt to explain why the spatial structure of the ULF wave in the ionosphere, seen by the Saskatoon Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radar, may differ from that deduced from the magnetometer data. The radar data are used to develop a two-dimensional (2-D) model of the spatial distribution of ULF amplitude and phase in the ionosphere. Our modeling shows that the differences between ground and ionosphere measurements may be explained by spatial integration. In general, m numbers deduced from ground measurements should be smaller than the ionospheric values, and they are strongly dependent on the ionospheric ULF amplitude and phase distribution in both latitude and longitude.},

   note = {The ionosphere offers an excellent laboratory for the study of atomic and molecular processes. Densities are low, permitting highly reactive species to accumulate in measurable quantities. Temporal and spatial scales are large, and the solar energy source causes substantial departures from thermodynamic equilibrium. This laboratory has been exploited by the Atmosphere Explorer Program of NASA. Simultaneous measurements of a large number of interrelated atmospheric parameters to altitudes as low as 150 km have provided data that can be analyzed in a quantitative manner to derive precise rates, as functions of temperature, for many important chemical reactions, including the reactions of electronically or vibrationally excited metastable species. Analysis of AE results has provided new information on the photochemical role of N in the thermosphere; the rate coefficients for dissociative recombination of NO+, O2+ and N2+; reactions of O+ with N2, N2+ with O, and O2+ with O; and reactions of metastable ions, atoms, and molecules. The progress in our understanding of ionospheric chemistry during the last few years shows the power of space science measurement programs carefully designed to provide rigorous tests of quantitative theoretical predictions.},

   abstract = {We examine ground-based observations of the meridional profile of 6300 ≈atmospheric emission from 67.3∞to 80.7∞invariant latitude for the signature of the polar cap boundary, the ionospheric boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines. The open-closed field line boundary is assumed to lie at the boundary between polar rain and plasma sheet precipitation. We assume that nonprecipitation-dependent sources of 6300 ≈emission cause a spatially uniform luminosity in the polar cap and that auroral zone luminosity is also spatially uniform. Therefore we determine the location of the polar cap boundary from the auroral emission data at each time by finding the best fit of the observations to a step function in latitude. Thus we produce a time series of the location of the polar cap boundary. We have developed criteria on the step function fit that identify when a reliable boundary identification has been obtained. Generally, where these criteria are not satisfied, the boundary is outside the latitudinal range of the optical observations. We compare the boundary identified from the emissions to the boundary in precipitating particle observations made by DMSP as it passes along a meridian within 1 1/2 hours of local time of the photometer. The latitudes of the two boundaries are highly correlated. During the expansion phase of substorms, however, there are large discrepancies apparently arising from longitudinal structure of the polar cap boundary associated with auroral surges. We conclude that 6300 ≈emissions provide a good means for monitoring the polar cap boundary continuously with an estimated precision of $\pm$0.9∞invariant latitude.},

  abstract = {Data collected during the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment during August and September 1987 show conclusively that a photochemical sink and not transport caused the ozone decline during that time. During the period August 23 to September 22, 1987, mixing ratios of trace constitutents with long lifetimes remained relatively constant for fixed potential temperature and latitude. Over the same period the ozone mixing ratio declined by more than 50% inside the polar vortex near 18 km altitude. This observation alone requires a substantial photochemical sink of ozone. The conservative tracer data indicate that the Lagrangian mean vertical velocity cannot have been upward inside the polar vortex where the ozone hole appeared. Tracer and ozone gradients in the region from 54$\,^\{\circ\}$ to 72$\,^\{\circ\}$S imply that ozone could be transported into the polar vortex during the spring season. Observed gradients of conserved tracers with respect to latitude and potential temperature are used to deduce a relationship between meridional mixing on potential temperature surfaces and mean diabatic descent in the vortex. The observed gradients and time tendency of ozone are then used to infer the magnitude of the effect of ozone transport in mitigating the springtime ozone decline, using an assumed best guess heating rate of 0.2 K d−1. It is estimated that ozone transport increased the requirement for a photochemical sink by about 20%$\pm$10% near the 425-K potential temperature level during the period of the 1987 experiment, so that transport from other latitudes or heights had a relatively weak influence on the development of the ozone hole in 1987. This estimate is also consistent with inferences based on the magnitude of the ozone gradient at the edge of the region of chemical depletion. The sharpness of the observed ozone drop with latitude at the edge of the ozone hole suggests relatively weak lateral mixing there. The tracer data also suggest that the amounts of lateral mixing and subsidence are strong functions of altitude, with more efficient mixing below about 400 K.},

Interestingly, the continental size modification of the ionospheric conductance modifies the global electric field, which should lead to measurable changes in the TEC in the southern conjugate hemisphere ( ≲1 TECU).},

   abstract = {We have developed objective criteria for choosing the location of the northern hemisphere polar vortex boundary region and the onset and breakup dates of the vortex. By determining the distribution of Ertel's potential vorticity (Epv) on equivalent latitudes, we define the vortex edge as the location of maximum gradient of Epv constrained by the location of the maximum wind jet calculated along Epv isolines. We define the vortex boundary region to be at the local maximum convex and concave curvature in the Epv distribution surrounding the edge. We have determined that the onset and breakup dates of the vortex on the 450 K isentropic surface occur when the maximum wind speed calculated along Epv isolines rises above and falls below approximately 15.2 m s−1. We use 1992--1993 as a test case to study the onset and breakup periods, and we find that the increase of polar vortex Epv values is associated with the dominance of the term in the potential vorticity equation involving the movement of air through the surface due to the diabatic circulation. We also find that the decrease is associated with the dominance of the term involving radiatively induced changes in the stability of the atmosphere.},

   abstract = {Particles of roughly magnetosheath energies precipitate at low altitudes throughout the dayside, in a band referred to as the cusp or cleft. Recently it has been suggested that the cusp proper is a more limited region of the cleft localized near noon, although the criteria for distinguishing between the two regions have been unclear. An investigation into the distinction between the low-altitude cusp and the cleft (with the latter herein identified as the ionospheric signature of the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL)) was performed on both a statistical and a case study basis. One year of DMSP F7 electron and ion data, comprising in all 5609 individual dayside passes, was employed. It was found that the average energy of precipitating particles allows for a clear morphological distinction between the cusp proper and the cleft/LLBL. Often both regions are observed on a given pass at the same MLT, each with its own characteristic properties. The probability of observing the cusp was found to be sharply peaked at 1200 MLT, while the probability of observing the cleft/LLBL was near unity away from noon and had a minimum at noon. The cusp was found to be 0.8$\,^\{\circ\}$--1.1$\,^\{\circ\}$ magnetic latitude (MLAT) thick essentially independent of MLT, whereas the cleft was thinnest at noon and widened rapidly at local times away from noon. The ion number flux in the cusp was statistically 3.6 times higher than in the cleft. The peak flux within the cusp was located on average closer to the equatorward than to the poleward boundary. Yearly average composite spectrograms of precipitation in the two regions as a function of local time show that the properties of the cusp change comparatively little with local time, but that the peak ion energy flux in the cleft increases smoothly from roughly magnetosheath values close to noon to about plasma sheet boundary layer values near 0600 MLT.},

  abstract = {Temperature data obtained by the Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere (CRISTA) are analyzed for gravity waves (GWs). Amplitude, phase and vertical wavelength are determined from detrended temperature height profiles. The retrieved phases are utilized to estimate the horizontal wavelengths. At 25 km altitude an equatorial maximum of horizontal wavelength with a decrease toward mid and high latitudes is found. Simultaneous estimates of both horizontal and vertical wavelengths and temperature amplitudes allow the direct calculation of GW momentum flux (MF) from satellite observations for the first time. However, histograms of horizontal wavelength distributions indicate severe undersampling which prevents the retrieval of the propagation directions of the waves, and suggests our MF estimates may be too low, particularly at the high latitudes. Therefore an empirical aliasing correction has been applied. A world map of MF at 25 km altitude shows high variability and pronounced source regions and deviates in structure from a map of GW variances at the same altitude. Results from the Warner and McIntyre GW parameterization scheme (three-part model) show better agreement with CRISTA MF estimates than with CRISTA squared GW amplitudes. Best agreement is found for low model launch levels. Large error ranges of the estimated MF values obtained in this paper could be substantially reduced by improved horizontal sampling in future satellite missions.},

It is shown that during quiet intervals gravity wave phase fronts may extend longitudinally for more than 3400 km. During the more active interval, the level of wave activity is elevated to the point that it is difficult to distinguish individual wave packets. Also, power spectra from the active period showed evidence of a harmonic sequence, indicating the possibility of some nonlinear process acting as the gravity waves propagate. Statistics of occurrence showed that high-latitude medium-scale gravity waves are more likely in the winter than in the summer and that the probability of observing waves on multiple radars is essentially the same as observing waves on any one radar.},

The waves exist under a wide variety of geomagnetic conditions; how ever, they are particularly noticeable under quiet conditions (0 \&\{\#\}8804; Kp \&\{\#\}8804; 1 +). The clearest signatures of the waves are spatially localized enhancements in the backscattered power and quasi-periodic fluctuations in the backscattered powers, Doppler velocities, and reflection heights. The waves are generally observed during daylight hours and propagate equatorward from regions of high-latitude ionospheric backscatter that are located near the ionospheric convection reversal boundary. The gravity waves appear to be generated just equatorward of the dayside flow-reversal boundary in the vicinity of the auroral electrojet at altitudes of 115 to 135 km and propagate approximately perpendicular to the boundary along azimuths ranging from 156∞to 180∞. The waves propagate obliquely downward through the lower atmosphere until they are reflected by the Earth\&\{\#\}8217;s surface back into the upper atmosphere. The frequencies associated with these gravity waves cover the range of 0.3 to 0.6 mHz, with wavelengths of 300 to 500 km, and with average phase velocities of 110 to 180 m/s. The maximum phase speeds are 270 to 300 m/s, which is slightly less than the speed of sound in the lower atmosphere. Poleward-propagating gravity waves are sometimes observed under disturbed conditions when the polar cap and convection reversal boundary have expanded equatorward.},

  abstract = {The midlatitude Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars regularly observe nighttime low‒velocity Sub‒Auroral Ionospheric Scatter (SAIS) from decameter‒scale ionospheric density irregularities during quiet geomagnetic conditions. To establish the origin of the density irregularities responsible for low‒velocity SAIS, it is necessary to distinguish between the effects of high frequency (HF) propagation and irregularity occurrence itself on the observed backscatter distribution. We compare range, azimuth, and elevation data from the Blackstone SuperDARN radar with modeling results from ray tracing coupled with the International Reference Ionosphere assuming a uniform irregularity distribution. The observed and modeled distributions are shown to be very similar. The spatial distribution of backscattering is consistent with the requirement that HF rays propagate nearly perpendicular to the geomagnetic field lines (aspect angle ≤1$\,^\{\circ\}$). For the first time, the irregularities responsible for low‒velocity SAIS are determined to extend between 200 and 300 km altitude, validating previous assumptions that low‒velocity SAIS is an F‒region phenomenon. We find that the limited spatial extent of this category of ionospheric backscatter within SuperDARN radars' fields‒of‒view is a consequence of HF propagation effects and the finite vertical extent of the scattering irregularities. We conclude that the density irregularities responsible for low‒velocity SAIS are widely distributed horizontally within the midlatitude ionosphere but are confined to the bottom‒side F‒region.},

   abstract = {Waves in the neutral upper atmosphere have been measured by the open source neutral mass spectrometer (Oss) during both the elliptical and the circular phases of the Atmosphere Explorer-C mission. Typical peak-to-peak wave amplitudes seen in [N2] are 30%, although amplitudes of 55% have been recorded. The amplitudes are mass dependent, Ar showing the largest perturbation. Helium is typically found to be out of phase with the heavier constituents. A survey of Oss data from 338 circular orbits shows that the highest wave amplitudes and the greatest number of occurrences are found in both the northern and the southern high-latitude regions. The near-simultaneous measurements of waves in both hemispheres at high latitudes also point toward a source related to conjugate phenomena. A possible second class of lower-amplitude waves peaks at high latitudes; however, a secondary peak near $\pm$25$\,^\{\circ\}$ magnetic latitude may be due to waves generated near the equatorial region. A study of wave amplitudes and occurrences during a magnetic storm shows a possible transpolar propagation of waves from a magnetically active region near local midnight. The assumption of horizontal propagation would explain the observed high-latitude distribution of large-amplitude waves. The results of this study are compared with previous measurements of neutral wave structure.},

  abstract = {Large impulsive geomagnetic field disturbances from auroral current systems have always been well understood as a concern for power grids in close proximity to these disturbance regions, predominantly at high-latitude locations. Magnetospheric shocks (SSCs) due to large-scale interplanetary pressure pulses are familiar from a geomagnetic disturbance perspective but have not been understood in the context as a potential driver for large geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). Observational evidence and analysis contained in this paper illustrate such events are capable of producing large geoelectric fields and associated GIC risks at any latitude, even equatorial locations. A large SSC disturbance on 24 March 1991 produced some of the largest GICs ever measured in the United States at midlatitude locations. The analysis methods and understanding of electromagnetic coupling processes at that time were unable to fully explain these observations. Electrojet-driven disturbances common at high-latitude locations during geomagnetic substorms cause large amplitude variations in locally observed B field, while SSC events are characterized as low-amplitude B field disturbance events. Disturbance amplitude only accounts for part of the electromagnetic coupling process. The attribute of spectral content of the disturbance is equally important and heretofore had not been well understood and was not well measured unless high-cadence observations were conducted. The deep-earth ground conductivity also provides an important enabling role at higher frequencies. Deep-earth ground response to geomagnetic field disturbances is highly frequency-dependent. Therefore for nearly all ground conditions the higher the spectral content of the incident magnetic field disturbance, the higher the relative geoelectric field response.},

It describes monthly averages of ionospheric densities and temperatures in the altitude range 50--1500 km in the non-auroral ionosphere. Since its inception in 1969 the \{IRI\} model has been steadily improved with newer data and with better mathematical descriptions of global and temporal variation patterns. A large number of independent studies have validated the \{IRI\} model in comparisons with direct and indirect ionospheric measurements not used in the model development. A comparison with \{IRI\} is often one of the first science tasks by an ionospheric satellite or rocket team. This paper describes the latest version of the \{IRI\} model, IRI-2007, explaining the most important changes that are being introduced with this version. These include: (1) two new options for the topside electron density, (2) a new model for the topside ion composition, (3) the first-time inclusion of a model for the spread F occurrence probability, (4) a NeuralNet model for auroral E-region electron densities, (5) a model for the plasmaspheric electron temperature, and (6) the latest International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model for the computation of magnetic coordinates including their changes due to the secular variation of the magnetic field.},

In addition, while much more variable, measurements in the slower, in-ecliptic wind match quantitatively with Ulysses and show essentially identical trends. Thus, these combined observations indicate significant, long-term variations in solar wind output from the entire Sun. The significant, long-term trend to lower dynamic pressures means that the heliosphere has been shrinking and the heliopause must be moving inward toward the Voyager spacecraft. In addition, our observations suggest a significant and global reduction in the mass and energy fed in below the sonic point in the corona. The lower supply of mass and energy may result naturally from a reduction of open magnetic flux during this period.},

   abstract = {A new technique for estimating electron density perturbation amplitudes of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs), using HF radar data, is presented. TIDs are observed in HF radar data as enhancements of the ground-scattered power which propagate through the radar\&\{\#\}8217;s field of view. These TIDs are the ionospheric manifestation of atmospheric acoustic-gravity waves. TID electron density perturbation amplitudes were estimated by simulating the radar returns, using HF ray tracing through a model ionosphere perturbed by a model gravity wave. The simulation determined the return power in the ground-scattered portion of the signal as a function of range, and this was compared to HF radar data from the Goose Bay HF radar at a time when evidence of gravity waves was present in the data. By varying the amplitude of the electron density perturbation in the model it was possible to estimate the perturbation of the actual wave. It was found that the perturbations that are observed by the Goose Bay HF radar are of the order of 20% to 35%. It was also found that the number of observable power enhancements, and the relative amplitudes of these enhancements, depended on the vertical thickness of the gravity wave\&\{\#\}8217;s source region. From the simulations and observations it was estimated that the source region for the case presented here was approximately 20 km thick. In addition, the energy in the wave packet was calculated and compared to an estimate of the available energy in the source region. It was found that the wave energy was about 0.2% of the estimated available source region energy.},

Horizontal propagation velocities deduced from the TID observations are consistent with predicted velocities for imperfectly ducted internal gravity waves at F-region heights. It is suggested that auroral zone perturbations are a possible generating mechanism for atmospheric gravity waves which then propagate in a southeasterly direction over great circle paths exceeding 5000 km and are manifested as large TIDs observed by the Boulder scan-backscatter sounder.},

  abstract = {All the details of ionospheric disturbances following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake were first revealed by the high-resolution GPS total electron content observation in Japan. The initial ionospheric disturbance appeared as sudden depletions following small impulsive TEC enhancements ∼7 minutes after the earthquake onset, near the epicenter. Then, concentric waves appeared to propagate in the radial direction with a velocity of 138-3,457 m/s. Zonally-extended enhancements of the TEC also appeared in the west of Japan. In the vicinity of the epicenter, short-period oscillations with a period of ∼4 minutes were observed. This paper focuses on the concentric waves. The concentric pattern indicates that they had a point source. The center of these structures, termed the "ionospheric epicenter", was located about 170 km from the epicenter in the southeast direction. According to the propagation characteristics, these concentric waves could be caused by atmospheric waves classified into three types: acoustic waves generated from a propagating Rayleigh wave, acoustic waves from the ionospheric epicenter, and atmospheric gravity waves from the ionospheric epicenter. The amplitude of the concentric waves was not uniform and was dependent on the azimuth of their propagation direction, which could not be explained by previously-proposed theory.},

   abstract = {Electromagnetic signals that propagate through the magnetosphere exchange energy with nonthermal charged particles by the cyclotron-resonance mechanism. The interaction is due to a Doppler shift of the propagation frequency ω to the cyclotron frequency ωc of the charged particle that allows the particle to resonate with the electromagnetic fields. The dominant exchange is between electrons around 1 kev and VLF whistlers that propagate in the right-hand mode and between protons around 1 kev and ULF whistlers (Pc 1 geomagnetic micropulsations) that propagate in the left-hand mode. The complex wave number k(ω) = kr + iki for propagation in a hot uniform plasma parallel to a static magnetic field is assumed to describe whistler properties locally in the magnetosphere. The power transfer function A(ω), which relates the input and output power spectrums, is determined by the path integral of ki along a geomagnetic flux tube. Spectrums of A for both VLF and ULF whistlers have been evaluated for a variety of energy and pitch-angle distributions of the form E−n sinm α. In general, A has an amplification maximum just below a sharp absorption cutoff, which is consistent with observations. The detailed input-output spectrums of whistlers that are necessary to test the theory are not available yet. When these spectrums are measured, this interaction may provide a possible method for mapping the phase space distribution of nonthermal particles in the magnetosphere.},

We characterize the gravity wave activity in terms of the measurements of buoyancy period and relative density fluctuations and estimate the potential energy density and growth of potential energy density with altitude. We use satellite and reanalysis data to analyze the synoptic structure of the stratospheric vortex and the Aleutian anticyclone, the planetary wave activity, and the mean winds. These three winters have a major stratospheric warming in 2002--2003, an extreme warming event in 2003--2004 resulting in an elevated stratopause, and no warming in 2004--2005. The gravity wave activity shows significant interannual variability, with an average potential energy density of 2.1 J/kg in 2002--2003, 1.1 J/kg in 2003--2004, and 5.7 J/kg in 2004--2005. We find a positive correlation of 0.74 between the gravity wave activity in the upper stratosphere and the winds in the lower stratosphere where the winds are lightest. The reduction in gravity wave activity in 2002--2003 relative to 2004--2005 reflects the influence of the Aleutian anticyclone that is present over Chatanika in 2002--2003 but absent in 2004--2005. The occurrence of lower gravity wave activity in 2003--2004, when the Aleutian anticyclone is present less often than in 2002--2003, supports recent modeling studies that indicate that the elevated stratopause is formed due to a reduction of gravity waves propagating upward into the mesosphere.},

Estimates of the magnitude of the diverted current by Haerendel \{$[$\}1992\{$]$\} and Shiokawa et al. \{$[$\}1997, 1998\{$]$\} tend to be lower than results from computer simulations of magnetotail reconnection and tail collapse \{$[$\}Birn and Hesse, 1996\{$]$\}, despite similar underlying models. An analysis of the differences between these estimates on the basis of the simulations gives a more refined picture of the diversion of perpendicular into parallel currents. The inertial currents considered by Haerendel \{$[$\}1992\{$]$\} and Shiokawa et al. \{$[$\}1997\{$]$\} contribute to the initial current reduction and diversion, but the dominant and more permanent contribution stems from the pressure gradient terms, which change in connection with the field collapse and distortion. The major effect results from pressure gradients in the z direction, rather than from the azimuthal gradients \{$[$\}Shiokawa et al., 1998\{$]$\}, combined with changes in B y and B z . The reduction of the current density near the equatorial plane is associated with a reduction of the curvature drift which overcompensates changes of the magnetization current and of the gradient B drift current. In contrast to the inertial current effects, the pressure gradient effects persist even after the burst of earthward flow ends.},

A typical wavelength of ∼150 km, larger amplitude, and smaller MSTID's tilt angles at lower latitudes are consistent with observations.

   abstract = {Magnetospheric plasma parameters during geomagnetically quiet conditions are studied with ion measurements covering energies from ∼1 keV to ∼4 MeV from the Charge Composition Explorer. It is found that the observed quiet time plasma pressure in the midnight sector is comparable (within a factor of 2) to that deduced by Spence et al. (1989) and Kan et al. (1992) from inverting the magnetic field models of Tsyganenko and Usmanov (1982) and Tsyganenko (1987). The radial profile of the total plasma pressure shows a peak generally at L ≈3 to 4 and decreases from L ≈4 to L ≈9 rather monotonically. No large-scale earthward decrease in plasma pressure occurs in these outer L shells, contrary to some theoretical expectation for the magnetospheric closure of the region 2 field-aligned current system. The plasma pressure within L ∼9 is generally anisotropic with a larger pressure component perpendicular to the magnetic field than parallel to the field. This anisotropy tends to increase with smaller L. While the anisotropy is always below the fire hose instability threshold during all quiet time passes studied, it is near the mirror instability threshold in the midnight sector at large L shells due mostly to the large value of plasma beta (>1) there. The radial profile of the azimuthal volume current density is also computed, with the result suggesting that the current density associated with the quiet time ring current population is distributed broadly over the L shells between L ≈3.5 and L ≈7 with average values in the range of ∼1 to 4 nA/m²and peak values in the range of ∼4 to 8 nA/m². Another current region situated beyond L ≈7, which may be related to the inner portion of the quiet time cross-tail current, is also apparent and has average and peak current density values similar to those of the ring current.},

Especially for the last three onsets, both ground\&\{\#\}8208;based and GOES 12 magnetometers sensed magnetic perturbations, as expected from the formation of a substorm current wedge (SCW). Moreover, LANL 1994\&\{\#\}8211;084 detected an enhancement of energetic particle flux. Spectral analysis shows a matched wave frequency \&\{\#\}8764;6\&\{\#\}8211;8 mHz and another harmonic frequency \&\{\#\}8764;17 mHz for the fourth burst. The orientation of the major axis of the wave polarization hodogram points toward the SCW location. The first burst has both latitudinal and longitudinal polarization changes from counterclockwise (CCW) to clockwise (CW), in contrast to the other three that have a latitudinal reversal only. The longitudinal CW to CCW change at low latitudes signifies that hydromagnetic waves propagate westward and eastward from the longitude of the impulsive source responsible for SCW. The latitudinal CW to CCW reversal is consistent with induction by a westward moving upward field\&\{\#\}8208;aligned current carried by AlfvÈn waves leading to field line oscillations. Consequently, they can be explained by the coupling of a fast magnetospheric cavity mode driven by fast compressional waves to field line resonances as expected from braking bursty bulk flows, resulting from magnetotail reconnection, triggered by a preceding northward interplanetary magnetic field turning. This event shows that the source mechanism of consecutive Pi2 onsets at times of weak geomagnetic activity is the same as during substorm times.},

@article{Rostoker1996,
   abstract = {This paper provides a phenomenological and theoretical framework for understanding magnetospheric substorms based on the boundary layer dynamics model developed by Rostoker and Eastman \{$[$\}1987\{$]$\} updated to be consistent with modern observations. The model is designed to account for both the directly driven and storage-release aspects of substorm activity. The essence of the model is that enhanced frontside reconnection leads to both growth of the directly driven electrojets and storage of energy in the magnetic field and particle drift in the tail. The growth of particularly intense cross-tail current near the inner edge of the plasma sheet is terminated by an abrupt collapse marking the onset of the expansive phase of the substorm. This collapse normally takes place in the midnight sector inside ∼−12 RE. The collapse of this cross-tail current is consistent with the breakdown of shielding associated with region 2 field-aligned currents. The expansive phase proceeds through antiearthward propagation in the tail of a wave triggered by the collapse. When the wave reaches the neutral line in the tail, it enhances the reconnection rate leading to stronger velocity shear along the interface between the low latitude boundary layer and central plasma sheet. This velocity shear is responsible for activity at the high latitude edge of the expanded auroral oval. The physics of the processes characterizing the model requires a reexamination of the Harang discontinuity as it would appear that there are actually two regions of electric field reversal in the nightside magnetosphere both of which play important roles in the substorm process.},

   abstract = {The longest total solar eclipse during the 21st century with a maximum duration of 6 min and 39 s occurred in South and East Asia on 22 July 2009. The TEC data from four GPS stations in the total eclipse region (around 30$\,^\{\circ\}$N) from 105$\,^\{\circ\}$E to 135$\,^\{\circ\}$E are used to study the variation in TEC. Height profiles of electron density from Formosa3/Cosmic satellites are used to study the height dependence of the electron density response. We also modeled the eclipse effects on the ionosphere by an ionospheric model. Both the observations from F3/C and the modeled results show that there is an overall decrease in the electron density below F2 region, with the largest relative decrease occurring at F1 region. The TEC observations show the delay time of the largest TEC decrease at the total eclipse region with regard to the maximum obscuration is less than five minutes and smaller than what is estimated from the time constant of the plasma loss rate at the F2 peak altitude although main contribution to TEC comes from the plasma density in the F2 region. The modeling study shows that, due to the large plasma flux from topside ionosphere to F2 layer, the TEC response around 30$\,^\{\circ\}$N is mainly due to the electron density response at low altitudes (E and F1 region, 200 km below) where the time delay of electron density response is very short (less than 4 min). Thus the time delay of TEC response would also be short as observed by GPS TEC.},

MSTIDs propagating southward from high latitudes are detected at first with the HF radar and then with the imager and GEONET. We analyze two MSTID events, one in winter (event 1) and the other in summer (event 2), to find that MSTIDs appear simultaneously, at least, at 55$\,^\{\circ\}$--25$\,^\{\circ\}$N. It is shown that nighttime MSTIDs propagate toward the southwest over a horizontal distance of about 4000 km, and daytime MSTIDs do so toward the southeast. Daytime radar echoes are due to ground/sea surface (GS) scatter, while nighttime echoes in event 1 return from 15-m-scale F region field-aligned irregularities (FAIs) and those in event 2 are due to GS scatter. Doppler velocities of the nighttime F region FAI echoes in event 1 are negative (motion away from the radar) within strong echo regions and are positive (motion toward the radar) within weak echo regions. This fact suggests that the strong (weak) echoes return from suppressed (enhanced) airglow/TEC areas, in line with previous observations over central Japan. The nighttime MSTIDs in events 1 and 2 are often accompanied by concurrent coherent echoes from FAIs in sporadic E (Es) layers. The Es echo areas in event 2 rather coincide with suppressed airglow/TEC areas in the F region that are connected with the echo areas along the geomagnetic field, indicating the existence of E and F region coupling at night.},

@article{Greifinger1968,
   abstract = {In this paper, we consider the propagation of low-frequency (Pc 1) hydromagnetic waves in the ionospheric duct, which results from the minimum in the Alfvén speed near the F2 ionization peak. We consider an inhomogeneous (in the vertical direction) waveguide in the presence of a uniform static magnetic field and treat the case of horizontal propagation in the plane of the magnetic meridian. Propagation in the waveguide is governed by two coupled equations for the horizontal components of the electric field. For nighttime conditions, where the ionized region of interest starts at sufficiently high altitude that the collision frequency of ions with neutrals is small compared with the ion cyclotron frequency, the two components become uncoupled, and only the isotropic, or fast wave, need be considered. For daytime conditions, however, coupling between the fast and slow waves must be taken into account; to simplify the analysis, the static field is assumed uniform in this case. To obtain analytic solution of the waveguide equations, it is necessary to have analytic approximations to the height dependence of the relevant ionospheric parameters; such approximations are constructed to fit some representative tabulated ionospheric profiles for a variety of conditions of time of day and sunspot activity. Solution of the waveguide equations subject to the appropriate boundary conditions results in a rather complicated dispersion relation between complex (horizontal) wave number and angular frequency. The solutions of the dispersion relation prescribe the allowed bands of propagation in the guide. It is shown that each band, including the lowest, has a low-frequency cutoff, and that the existence of a low-frequency cutoff is a consequence of the boundary conditions and not of attenuation, as assumed in some theories. Numerical solutions of the dispersion equation are obtained for the two lowest bands for each of the conditions considered. From the dependence of the real part of the wave number on frequency, the cutoff frequencies and the phase and group velocities are determined, while the imaginary part provides the attenuation length. For nighttime conditions, attenuation is not large, and propagation can take place over distances of thousands of km, whereas daytime propagation is restricted by attenuation to distances of the order of hundreds of km. For nighttime minimum conditions, the calculated waveguide cutoff is about 0.4 cps, and the group velocity for the lowest band is about 720 km/sec, both in reasonable agreement with experiment. Finally, it is pointed out that there is an effective high-frequency `cutoff' (in any band) as far as ground-level signals are concerned due to an exponential decrease of transmission coefficient with frequency at high frequencies.},

@article{FullerRowell1996,
   abstract = {Ionosonde observations have provided the data to build a picture of the response of the midlatitude ionosphere to a geomagnetic storm. The particular characteristic of interest is the preference for ``negative storms'' (decrease in the peak electron density, NmF2) in summer and ``positive storms'' (increase in NmF2) in winter. A three-dimensional, time-dependent model of the coupled thermosphere and ionosphere is used to explain this dependence. During the driven phase of a geomagnetic storm the two main magnetospheric energy sources to the upper atmosphere (auroral precipitation and convective electric field) increase dramatically. Auroral precipitation increases the ion density and conductivity of the upper atmosphere; the electric field drives the ionosphere and, through collisions, forces the thermosphere into motion and then deposits heat via Joule dissipation. The global wind response is divergent at high latitudes in both hemispheres. Vertical winds are driven by the divergent wind field and carry molecule-rich air to higher levels. Once created, the ``composition bulge'' of increased mean molecular mass is transported by both the storm-induced and background wind fields. The storm winds imposed on the background circulation do not have a strong seasonal dependence, and this is not necessary to explain the observations. Numerical computations suggest that the prevailing summer-to-winter circulation at solstice transports the molecule-rich gas to mid and low latitudes in the summer hemisphere over the day or two following the storm. In the winter hemisphere, poleward winds restrict the equatorward movement of composition. The altered neutral-chemical environment in summer subsequently depletes the F region midlatitude ionosphere to produce a ``negative storm''. In winter midlatitudes a decrease in molecular species, associated with downwelling, persists and produces the characteristic ``positive storm''.},

New methodologies are developed that identify vortices in terms of evolving three-dimensional (3-D) air masses. A case study illustrates the performance of the identification schemes during February and March of 1999 when a merger of anticyclones led to a stratospheric warming that split the Arctic polar vortex. The 3-D structure and temporal evolution of the Arctic vortex and identified anticyclones demonstrates the algorithm's ability to capture complicated phenomena. The mean geographical distribution of polar vortex and anticyclone frequency is shown for each season. The frequency distributions illustrate the climatological location and persistence of polar vortices and anticyclones. A counterpart to the Aleutian High is documented in the Southern Hemisphere: the ``Australian High.'' The temporal evolution of the area occupied by polar vortices and anticyclones in each hemisphere is shown as a function of potential temperature. Large polar vortex area leads to an increase in anticyclone area, which in turn results in a decrease in the size of the polar vortex. During Northern winter and Southern spring, 9 years of daily anticyclone movement are shown on the 1200 K (36 km, 4 hPa) isentropic surface. Preferred locations of anticyclogenesis are related to cross-equatorial flow and weak inertial stability. Regimes of traveling and stationary anticyclones are discussed.},

   abstract = {The present paper deals with the transient behavior of MHD perturbations in the inner magnetosphere induced by an impulsive localized eastward current (source current) as a model of Pi2 pulsations in the magnetosphere. The magnetospheric model consists of a dipole magnetic field, plasmasphere, ionosphere with Pedersen conductivity, and a free outer boundary. The source current is an impulsive magnetospheric current at the onset of the substorm current wedge and is distributed around the equatorial plane of L = 10 with $\pm$2 hour longitudinal extent around midnight. The numerical results allow us to track variation in the expected Pi2 pulsation signals in both local time and L. The poloidal-mode wave exhibits plasmasphere virtual resonance, resulting in large amplitudes around midnight, weakening toward dayside. The toroidal-mode wave is excited as a field line resonance immediately after the wave front of the poloidal-mode wave crosses regions where the radial gradient of VA is steep. The toroidal-mode wave has largest amplitude at the local time of the east/west edge of the source current. The duration of this wave is \&\{\#\}8764;5 min. In the middle plasmasphere where the radial gradient of the VA is smaller, the poloidal-mode wave tends to predominate over the toroidal-mode wave. These numerical results are consistent with satellite observations, in so far as the day-night asymmetry of Pi2 pulsations and the observation of transient toroidal waves.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in GPS data processing have demonstrated that ground-based GPS receivers are capable of detecting ionospheric TEC perturbations caused by surface-generated Rayleigh, acoustic and gravity waves. There have been a number of publications discussing TEC perturbations immediately following the M 9.0 Tohoku earthquake in Japan on March 11, 2011. Most investigators have focused on the ionospheric responses up to a few hours following the earthquake and tsunami. In our research, in addition to March 11, 2011 we investigate global ionospheric TEC perturbations a day before and after the event. We also compare indices of geomagnetic activity on all three days with perturbations in TEC, revealing strong geomagnetic storm conditions that are also apparent in processed GEONET TEC observations. In addition to the traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) produced by the earthquake and tsunami, we also detect "regular" TIDs across Japan about 5 hours following the Tohoku event, concluding these are likely due to geomagnetic activity. The variety of observed TEC perturbations are consistent with tsunami-generated gravity waves, auroral activity, regular TIDs and equatorial fluctuations induced by increased geomagnetic activity. We demonstrate our capabilities to monitor TEC fluctuations using JPL's real-time Global Assimilative Ionospheric Model (GAIM) system. We show that a real-time global TEC monitoring network is able to detect the acoustic and gravity waves generated by the earthquake and tsunami. With additional real-time stations deployed, this new capability has the potential to provide real-time monitoring of TEC perturbations that could potentially serve as a plug-in to enhance existing early warning systems.},

   abstract = {Many years of research have demonstrated that large, nonrecurrent geomagnetic storms, shock wave disturbances in the solar wind, and energetic particle events in interplanetary space often occur in close association with large solar flares. This result has led to a paradigm of cause and effect - that large solar flares are the fundamental cause of these events in the near-Earth space environment. This paradigm, which I call ``the solar flare myth,'' dominates the popular perception of the relationship between solar activity and interplanetary and geomagnetic events and has provided much of the pragmatic rationale for the study of the solar flare phenomenon. Yet there is good evidence that this paradigm is wrong and that flares do not generally play a central role in producing major transient disturbances in the near-Earth space environment. In this paper I outline a different paradigm of cause and effect that removes solar flares from their central position in the chain of events leading from the Sun to near-Earth space. Instead, this central role is given to events known as coronal mass ejections.},

   abstract = {In contrast to the extensively studied growth and expansion phases of magnetospheric substorms, the substorm recovery phase has not received much attention in the published literature. It has generally been considered as a period in which all disturbances caused by the previous two phases decay, the magnetosphere ``recovers''to reach a quiet state again. Using mainly ground-based data, we show that the ``recovery phase''contains a number of features which are qualitatively different from the expansion phase, that is, not just a decay of previously excited forms of energy release. Typical recovery phase phenomena include intense electrojet activity in the morning sector, high-energy particle precipitation, the development of large-scale auroral vortex streets (so-called Ωbands and associated magnetic Ps 6 pulsations), and very often new eastward expanding active auroral phenomena, not unlike evening-sector expansion phase features but concentrated to the morning sector of the auroral oval. Such features must be associated with the substorm mechanism itself. We suggest that our observations during the substorm recovery phase are explained by the magnetospheric reorganization after the ejection of a plasmoid. We show that a more detailed investigation of the late substorm features can increase our understanding of the physical processes leading to the complete cycle of magnetospheric energy release.},

   abstract = {Gravity waves in the lower polar stratosphere are examined using operational radiosonde observations gathered from 33 stations over a period of 10 years. Both the potential and kinetic energies of the gravity waves vary annually and reach maxima in winter in the Arctic and in spring in the Antarctic. In the Antarctic spring a region of large gravity wave energy propagates downward following the movement of a zone of high static stability associated with Southern Hemispheric warming. Moreover, the enhanced energy region and the high stability zone coincide in the horizontal plane and move gradually from 135$\,^\{\circ\}$E, 50$\,^\{\circ\}$S to 45$\,^\{\circ\}$W, 70$\,^\{\circ\}$S over the South Pole. The vertical and horizontal directions of wave propagation are examined using hodograph analysis in the vertical. Most gravity waves transfer energy upward in the Arctic, while the percentage of downward energy propagation is relatively high in winter and spring in the Antarctic. Horizontally, gravity waves propagate westward relative to the mean wind in the Arctic, while in the Antarctic the dominant direction varies from station to station. The correlation between gravity wave energy in the lower stratosphere and the mean wind is also examined. In the Arctic, gravity wave energy is highly correlated with the surface wind, though in the Antarctic it correlates with the stratospheric wind. These results suggest that gravity waves observed in the Arctic are forced by topography, whereas in Antarctica some sources may exist in the stratosphere. One such source candidate is likely to be the polar night jet.},

   abstract = {The relationship between the plasma density and the mode of Pi2-band (40--150 s) waves in the magnetosphere is studied using measurements made from the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES). We focus on wave events that occurred from 1100 to 1500 UT on February 17, 1991, on a single CRRES orbit. During this interval the low-latitude ground station Kakioka (L = 1.2) observed a series of Pi2 pulsations within 2 hours of the local time of CRRES. When CRRES was in the plasmasphere, the poloidal components (E y , B x , B z ) at the spacecraft had high coherence with the Pi2 pulsations seen at Kakioka, where E y , B x , and B z are, respectively, the azimuthal component of the electric field and the radial and compressional components of the magnetic field. This relationship lasted until the spacecraft completely moved into the plasmatrough. Waves were present in the plasmatrough, but they did not maintain high coherence with the ground Pi2. For a plasmaspheric event, E y and B z oscillated nearly in quadrature, in support of a radially standing wave mode. These results confirm previous AMPTE/CCE magnetic field studies that suggested that fast-mode waves in the inner magnetosphere are the source of low-latitude Pi2 pulsations. In addition, the CRRES results strongly suggest that the outer limit of the ``inner magnetosphere''is the plasmapause. The observed wave properties are discussed in light of possible Pi2 mechanisms, including plasmaspheric cavity modes and braking of periodic bursty bulk flows.},

  abstract = {During geomagnetic storms, the ionospheric F region electron density may be greatly increased or decreased, which are termed positive storms or negative storms. It is generally accepted that negative storm phases are caused by neutral composition changes. In contrast, different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the generation of positive storm phases. In this paper, we present observations of a strong positive storm at middle latitudes. The Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar detected significant increases of the midlatitude ionospheric F region electron density during a magnetic storm on 3 April 2004. The positive phase of the ionospheric storm started to occur in the morning sector (0912 LT at Millstone Hill) and lasted for more than 10 hours. Compared with the quiet-time ionosphere, the daytime F peak altitude over Millstone Hill during the storm was ∼80 km higher, the F region electron density was increased by a factor of 2--4, and the F region electron temperature was decreased by ∼1000 K (or ∼40%). The radar also measured an enhanced eastward electric field and a slightly more equatorward neutral wind. Global GPS measurements show that total electron content (TEC) was increased at middle latitudes and decreased at lower latitudes, and the large TEC enhancements occurred primarily in the Atlantic sector. We suggest that electric fields may play an important role in the generation of the observed positive storm phase. The eastward electric field will cause increases in the midlatitude ionospheric electron density by moving the plasma particles upward and decreases in the equatorial ionospheric electron density by strengthening the fountain effect. The daytime poleward wind was reduced or even reversed during the storm, which may also contribute to the occurrence of the positive storm.},

Radar datasets are available from 2007 to 2014 for the Hokkaido and from 2013 to 2014 for the Ekaterinburg radar. In the case of the Hokkaido East radar, we have utilized the elevation angle information to study the MSTIDs propagating at the heights of the E and F ionospheric regions separately. We have analyzed the diurnal and seasonal behavior of the following medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbance (MSTID) parameters: propagation direction, apparent horizontal velocity and wavelength, period, and relative amplitude. The F region MSTID azimuthal patterns were observed to be quite similar by the two radars. The E region northwestward MSTIDs (from 280\{\textdegree\} to 320\{\textdegree\}) were typical of summer daytime. Comparison with the horizontal wind model (HWM07) has showed that the dominant MSTID propagation directions match the anti-wind direction well, at least during sunlight hours. We have also found that the wavelength and period tend to decrease with an increase in solar activity. On the contrary, the relative amplitude increases with an increase in solar activity. Moreover, the relative amplitude tends to increase with increasing auroral electrojet (AE) index, as do the wavelength and velocity.},

  abstract = {There are two plasma-structuring mechanisms that are known to operate at night in the midlatitude ionosphere, the Perkins instability (Perkins, 1973) in the F region, and the more recently discovered sporadic-E layer (EsL) instability (Cosgrove and Tsunoda, 2002) in the E region. Both are layer processes, whose coupled response has been shown to be more unstable than either by itself (Cosgrove and Tsunoda, 2004). Derived growth rates, however, were given only in terms of the most unstable mode; exactly how the individual growth rates in the Es and F layers are affected by coupling remains to be shown. To do so, simplified descriptions of the instabilities are derived in this paper to show that the growth rates of both layer instabilities are enhanced by additional vertical drifts produced by polarization electric fields that map between regions along geomagnetic field lines. Key findings are (1) largest enhancement is in the growth rate of F region structure (γPc), (2) γPc is controlled by the EsL instability, and (3) additional positive feedback to the EsL instability occurs because of its dependence on the field-line-integrated Pedersen conductivity of the F layer. An important byproduct of this study is the finding that a more consistent interpretation of existing data is possible, if we assume that the coupled system involves a large-scale, but finite-sized, Es patch. These new findings seem to explain several puzzling observations that are associated with midlatitude spread F.},

The January 1993 period (the so-called ``10-day run'') yielded a rich data set of gravity wave signatures, perhaps the first case of direct imaging of thermospheric wave train properties in the F region. The 6-month 1995 campaign revealed two additional optical signatures of F region dynamics. A brightness wave in 6300 Åpassing rapidly through the field of view (FOV) has been linked to meridional winds driven by the midnight temperature maximum (MTM) pressure bulge. On May 3, 1995, during a period of geomagnetic activity, a 6300-Åairglow depletion pattern entered the Arecibo FOV. Such effects represent the optical signatures of equatorial spread F instabilities that rise above the equator to heights near 2500 km, thereby affecting Arecibo's L = 1.4 flux tube.},

The eclipse period was characterized by a low level of geomagnetic disturbance (Dst-variation from −10 to −20 nT), which alleviated significantly the problem of detecting the ionospheric response to the eclipse. Our analysis revealed a well-defined effect of a decrease (depression) of the total electron content (TEC) for all GPS stations. The delay between minimum TEC values with respect to the totality phase near the eclipse path increased gradually from 4 min in Greenwich longitude (10:40 UT, LT) to 8 min at the longitude 16$\,^\{\circ\}$(12:09 LT). The depth and duration of the TEC depression were found to be 0.2--0.3 TECU and 60 min, respectively.

   note = {We have examined the spatial and temporal correlation of high-latitude Pi1B and Pi2 pulsations, mid-latitude Pi2 pulsations, and auroral substorm onsets identified in the IMAGE far ultraviolet imager (FUV) data. Numerous search coil and fluxgate magnetometers at high latitudes (65-80∞ in Antarctica and Greenland) and mid-latitude fluxgate magnetometers are used. We find that Pi1B onset times agree well with onset times of intense isolated auroral substorms identified by the IMAGE FUV instrument: Pi1B onsets occurred within the 2†min cadence of the imager. For any given event, we find that Pi1B are localized to approximately 4†h of local time and 7∞ of magnetic latitude relative to the initial auroral brightening location as observed by IMAGE FUV. Not surprisingly, we also find that Pi1B pulsations occur typically between 2100 and 0200†MLT. Comparison to Pi2 records from these and other lower-latitude stations shows that in almost all cases Pi1B activity coincides within $\pm$2†min with Pi2 activity. Power law fits showed that Pi1B amplitude fell off with distance-2.9 for two strong events (i.e., similar to the r-3 falloff of the signal from a dipolar source), and only slightly more rapidly than the falloff of Pi2 activity (d-2.8). Given the global nature of Pi2 pulsations versus the localized nature of Pi1B events in this study, we conclude that the mechanism that drives Pi1B pulsations is likely different from that responsible for Pi2 pulsations.},

It has been found that the amount of wave energy in the upper stratosphere is related to the position of the stratospheric polar vortex. In each of the four winters reported here, the wave activity was a maximum within the westerly jet at the edge of the vortex, a minimum inside the vortex near its centre and intermediate outside the vortex. The spectra of wave induced fluctuations show that it is at the longest resolved vertical wavelengths (8 to 15 km) that wave energy is being influenced by the background meteorological conditions. These findings are interpreted in terms of the Doppler shifting and critical level filtering that is imposed by the background wind profile.},

Here we use superposition of unique circumstances, current deep solar minimum and a record-breaking stratospheric warming event, to gain new insights into causes of ionospheric perturbations. We show large (50--150%) persistent variations in the low-latitude ionosphere (200--1000 km) that occur several days after a sudden warming event in the high-latitude winter stratosphere (∼30 km). We rule out solar irradiance and geomagnetic activity as explanations of the observed variation. Using a general circulation model, we interpret these observations in terms of large changes in atmospheric tides from their nonlinear interaction with planetary waves that are strengthened during sudden warmings. We anticipate that further understanding of the coupling processes with planetary waves, accentuated during the stratospheric sudden warming events, has the potential of enabling the forecast of low-latitude ionospheric weather up to several days in advance.},

  abstract = {Using global positioning system (GPS) data taken from the International GNSS Service (IGS), we investigated total electron content (TEC) perturbations associated with medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs). We analyzed TEC data taken from four or five GPS receivers in each of six regions (Japan, Europe, eastern United States, western United States, Australia, and South America) in 3 years (1998, 2000, and 2001). To derive perturbation components of TEC (I′), we subtracted the 1-hour running average form the time sequence of TEC for each satellite--receiver pair. Standard deviation of I′ within 1 hour, δI, was calculated every hour, and MSTIDs activity were defined as δI/, where is the 1-hour average of absolute vertical TEC. We found that MSTIDs activity during daytime is different from that during nighttime with respect to seasonal, solar activity, longitudinal, and latitudinal dependences. Daytime MSTIDs activity are high in winter in all six regions. On the other hand, seasonal variation of nighttime MSTIDs activity is coupled with its longitudinal variation. In the Japanese and Australian longitudinal sector, nighttime MSTIDs are most active near the June solstice, whereas it is most active near the December solstice in the European longitudinal sector. Nighttime MSTIDs activity at the Japanese and Australian longitudinal sector shows negative correlation with solar activity, whereas solar activity dependence is not seen in daytime MSTIDs activity. These results suggest that mechanisms causing MSTIDs could be different between daytime and nighttime.},

   note = {We have operated a very long baseline interferometer array at a northern midlatitude site, illuminated by VHF radio beacons from two geosynchronous satellites, quasi-continuously for over a year. The array can detect and measure the trace velocity of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) via their signatures in the line-of-sight total electron content (TEC). The system noise level is of the order of 1013 m−2 in the TEC, so that even very weak perturbations can be studied. We have used the year-long TID detection/velocimetry data set to describe local time and seasonal dependences of the wave parameters. The most striking finding is that the preferred azimuths of TIDs in the data set tend to belong to either of two modes: The first mode, strongest at midday and in the early afternoon, particularly around winter equinox, propagates southward. The second mode, strongest in the evening, especially during summer solstice through autumn equinox, propagates west-northwestward. The two modes are disposed in local time such as to suggest the agency of clockwise rotation of the TID preferred azimuths versus time, as expected by wind filtering in the thermospheric diurnal tide. However, there is a gap between the two modes' azimuth bands. Moreover, the two modes exist in all trace-speed quartiles of the data set TIDs, a finding which is at variance with the hypothesis of wind filtering being the primary explanation of these modes.},

   abstract = {The phenomenon described in this paper is the occurrence of a very sudden change in ionization of a portion of the ionosphere. It manifests itself by the complete fading out of high-frequency radio transmission for a period of a few minutes to an hour or more, and by perturbations of terrestrial magnetism and earth currents. The effect was discovered in 1935, and found to occur simultaneously everywhere throughout the illuminated half of the globe but not in the night half. The results of a world-wide investigation of the phenomenon which followed this discovery are presented in this paper. The radio and magnetic effects have been shown to be of a distinct type, quite different from previously known vagaries in these fields. They are of maximum intensity in that region of the earth where the sun's radiation is perpendicular. Many of the occurrences are simultaneous with great eruptions on the sun. Such eruptions emit vast quantities of ultraviolet light. These radiations are sometimes of such frequencies as to cause intense ionization of part of the ionosphere below the E layer. This sudden ionization causes the radio and other perturbations. Their characteristics are explained. Study of this effect is leading to new understanding of the nature of the ionosphere, the processes of radio wave transmission, the mechanisms of terrestrial magnetism, and the phenomena occurring in the sun.},

It has been found that quasi-periodic travelling disturbances with periods of from 10 to 60 min. are of frequent occurrence in the F region by day. They appear as temporary variations in the vertical distribution of ionization which show a horizontal progression and a vertical progression downwards. The horizontal directions of travel have a well-defined mean direction on most days. The mean direction shows a marked seasonal variation with a sudden change at each equinox. The horizontal rate of travel is usually between 5 and 10 km./min., and the rate of vertical progression downwards is approximately half the horizontal rate. The disturbances are considered to be variations of a compressional type in the atmosphere resulting in changes in the distribution of ionization.},

The instability, which takes the form of rising and falling sheets of ionization, has a growth rate γ ≈ 3 × 10−4 νin−1 sec−1, where νin is ion-neutral collision frequency at the F region peak. These conclusions are based on a set of new moment equations that govern the time evolution of the Pedersen conductance and the plasma content of a flux tube. It is argued that temperate- and high-latitude spread F are a result of this instability. The new moment equations also predict: (1) that there is a maximum height-integrated Pedersen current that the F region can carry; and (2) that barium clouds deform in agreement with observations of recent releases.},

While some Pi2 occur just before substorm onset, others do not show any casual relation to substorm activity so that the Pi2 generation and propagation mechanisms are still unclear. The bulk of information on Pi2 morphology is provided by ground-based magnetometers, subject to distortions due to transition through the highly conducting lower ionosphere. While space-borne magnetometers provide important in situ information, they cannot match the spatio-temporal continuity of ground-based instruments. In this paper, we devise a novel approach using co-located high-frequency ionospheric radars and ground magnetometers for the first direct observation of the Pi2 wave polarization transition between the ionosphere and the ground. Furthermore, application of the Hilbert transform enables us to reconstruct the transition dynamics, which resolves an apparent disagreement between the Pi2 spectra measured by the two instruments.},

@article{Friedman1966,
   abstract = {The reflection of internal gravity waves in a thermally stratified atmosphere may result in the formation of a wave duct between a strongly reflecting region and the ground. In some cases total reflection occurs and wave energy propagates horizontally in the duct without loss. In other cases, however, the reflection is not total but is nevertheless strong; in these latter cases the duct is `imperfect,' and wave energy is carried to great distances with only minor loss in the form of a leakage into the overlying regions. In this paper the imperfect ducting of internal gravity waves in thermally stratified atmospheres is analyzed numerically, temperature profiles generally representative of summer and winter conditions being studied in detail. Modal solutions relating the frequencies, wavelengths, propagation speeds, and attenuation indices to one another are obtained. An evaluation of the role in the ducting process of the atmospheric temperature profile is made using computed patterns of energy flow and vertical distributions of energy density. The results show the existence of propagation modes which are strongly ducted by the atmosphere and which have properties that are in general agreement with traveling ionospheric disturbances in the F region.},

New insights are possible using the new generation of fully coupled three-dimensional models, together with extensive ionospheric databases. The period of postsolar maximum geomagnetic storms in October and November 2003 were some of the largest storms ever recorded. In this paper, we explore how the thermosphere-ionosphere system responded to the onset of the 20 November 2003 geomagnetic storm, using the NCAR TIMEGCM. The model simulates dramatic changes in the thermospheric equatorward winds, O/N2, and corresponding ionospheric electron densities. The model is used as a framework to interpret an increase in the observed ionospheric total electron content, and F region electron density, in the European and North African sector, in terms of changes in the neutral gas. Corresponding compositional effects observed by the GUVI instrument on the TIMED satellite lend credence to the model results. We describe some of the important physical processes that will affect planning for the utilization of measurements from the Geospace investigations in NASA's Living With a Star Program. The study illustrates the value of measuring both the neutral and ionized gases, of obtaining quasi-global views from imaging instruments, and the synergy between satellite data, ground-based measurements, and models.},

   abstract = {Four numerical simulations have been performed, at equinox, using a coupled thermosphere-ionosphere model, to illustrate the response of the upper atmosphere to geomagnetic storms. The storms are characterized by an increase in magnetospheric energy input at high latitude for a 12-hour period; each storm commences at a different universal time (UT). The initial response at high latitude is that Joule heating raises the temperature of the upper thermosphere and ion drag drives high-velocity neutral winds. The heat source drives a global wind surge, from both polar regions, which propagates to low latitudes and into the opposite hemisphere. The surge has the character of a large-scale gravity wave with a phase speed of about 600 m s−1. Behind the surge a global circulation of magnitude 100 m s −1 is established at middle latitudes, indicating that the wave and the onset of global circulation are manifestations of the same phenomena. A dominant feature of the response is the penetration of the surge into the opposite hemisphere where it drives poleward winds for a few hours. The global wind surge has a preference for the night sector and for the longitude of the magnetic pole and therefore depends on the UT start time of the storm. A second phase of the meridional circulation develops after the wave interaction but is also restricted, in this case by the buildup of zonal winds via the Coriolis interaction. Conservation of angular momentum may limit the buildup of zonal wind in extreme cases. The divergent wind field drives upwelling and composition change on both height and pressure surfaces. The composition bulge responds to both the background and the storm-induced horizontal winds; it does not simply rotate with Earth. During the storm the disturbance wind modulates the location of the bulge; during the recovery the background winds induce a diurnal variation in its position. Equatorward winds in sunlight produce positive ionospheric changes during the main driving phase of the storm. Negative ionospheric phases are caused by increases of molecular nitrogen in regions of sunlight, the strength of which depends on longitude and the local time of the sector during the storm input. Regions of positive phase in the ionosphere persist in the recovery period due to decreases in mean molecular mass in regions of previous downwelling. Ion density changes, expressed as a ratio of disturbed to quiet values, exhibit a diurnal variation that is driven by the location of the composition bulge; this variation explains the ac component of the local time variation of the observed negative storm phase.},

   abstract = {We present a study of the proton cyclotron instability in the Earth's outer magnetosphere, L > 7, using Active Magnetosphere Particle Tracer Explorers/Charge Composition Explorer (AMPTE/CCE) magnetic field, ion, and plasma wave data. The analysis addresses the energy of protons that generate the waves, the ability of linear theory to predict both instability and stability, comparison of the predicted wave properties with the observed wave polarization and frequency, and the temperature anisotropy/parallel beta relation. The data were obtained during 24 intervals of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave activity (active) and 24 intervals from orbits without EMIC waves (quiet). This is the same set of events used by Anderson and Fuselier [1994]. The active events are drawn from noon and dawn local times for which the wave properties are significantly different. For instability analysis, magnetospheric hot proton distributions required the use of multiple populations to analytically represent the data. Cyclotron waves are expected to limit the proton temperature anisotropy, Ap = T⊥p/T‖p − 1, according to Ap < aβ‖pc with a ∼ 1 and c ∼ 0.5, where T⊥p, T‖p, and β‖p are the perpendicular and parallel proton temperatures and the proton parallel beta, respectively. During cyclotron wave events, Ap should be close to aβ‖pc whereas in the absence of waves Ap should be below aβ‖pc. The active dawn cases yielded instability in 9 of 12 cases using the measured plasma data with an average growth rate γ/Ωp = 0.025 and followed the relation Ap = 0.85β‖p−0.52. The active noon events gave instability in 10 of 12 cases, but only when an additional ∼2 cm−3 cold plasma was assumed. The noon wave events fell well below the dawn events in Ap-β‖p space, slightly above the Ap = 0.2β‖p−0.5 curve. The lower Ap limit for the noon cases is attributed to the presence of unmeasured cold plasma. The quiet events were all stable even for additional assumed cold ion densities of up to 10 cm−3, the upper limit implied by the plasma wave data. The quiet events gave Ap < 0.2β‖p−0.5. At noon, the unstable component has T⊥p ∼ 20 keV and Ap ∼0.8. At dawn the unstable component has T⊥p ∼ 4 keV and Ap ∼ 2.3. Observed wave frequencies agree with the frequencies of positive growth, and the difference in frequency between noon and dawn is attributable to the combined effects of the different hot proton T⊥p and Ap and the inferred higher cold plasma density at noon. The dawn events had significant growth for highly oblique waves, suggesting that the linear polarization of the dawn waves may be due to domination of the wave spectrum by waves generated with oblique wave vectors.},

  abstract = {Enhancements of the fluxes of protons having energies of several hundred keV are commonly observed at synchronous orbit and in the magnetotail during geomagnetically active periods. In many cases these flux enhancements have been shown to be closely associated with individual magnetospheric substorms. Using energetic proton data (Ep >0.3 MeV) from synchronous orbiting satellites and from Vela satellites in the magnetotail, we find that the timing of proton enhancements relative to substorm onsets and recoveries (derived from ground magnetic records) and relative to plasma sheet thinnings and recoveries (measured with plasma probes on the Imp 7, Imp 8, and Vela satellites) can be understood in terms of a neutral line model of substorms in which the protons are impulsively accelerated, possibly near the neutral line(s), during a brief period at substorm onset. The energized particles subsequently appear to stream both sunward and antisunward as discrete particle bunches with those flowing sunward observed in the inner magnetosphere as `drift echoes'and those flowing antisunward seen in the magnetotail as single short, intense 'impulsive'bursts. The more commonly observed rapid-rise slow-decay type of plasma sheet proton enhancements occur during the substorm recovery phase and are, in the present model, attributed to envelopment of the observing satellite by the recovering (i.e., expanding) plasma sheet into which have leaked protons previously injected into the outer radiation zone. We find that many of the energetic proton bursts reported by other research groups, when examined together with concurrent plasma measurements, are also consistent with this model. This paper describes events from our own records and from the published reports of others and offers a unified view of such energetic proton flux enhancements.},

The instrument consists of a pair of ``top hat'' electrostatic analyzers with common 180$\,^\{\circ\}$×6$\,^\{\circ\}$ fields-of-view that sweep out 4π steradians each 3 s spin period. Particles are detected by microchannel plate detectors and binned into six distributions whose energy, angle, and time resolution depend upon instrument mode. On-board moments are calculated, and processing includes corrections for spacecraft potential. This paper focuses on the ground and in-flight calibrations of the 10 sensors on five spacecraft. Cross-calibrations were facilitated by having all the plasma measurements available with the same resolution and format, along with spacecraft potential and magnetic field measurements in the same data set. Lessons learned from this effort should be useful for future multi-satellite missions.},

   abstract = {Some of the most intense solar flares measured in 0.1 to 0.8 nm x-rays in recent history occurred near the end of 2003. The Nov 4 event is the largest in the NOAA records (X28) and the Oct 28 flare was the fourth most intense (X17). The Oct 29 flare was class X7. These flares are compared and contrasted to the July 14, 2000 Bastille Day (X10) event using the SOHO SEM 26.0 to 34.0 nm EUV and TIMED SEE 0.1--194 nm data. High time resolution, ∼30s ground-base GPS data and the GUVI FUV dayglow data are used to examine the flare-ionosphere relationship. In the 26.0 to 34.0 nm wavelength range, the Oct 28 flare is found to have a peak intensity greater than twice that of the Nov 4 flare, indicating strong spectral variability from flare-to-flare. Solar absorption of the EUV portion of the Nov 4 limb event is a possible cause. The dayside ionosphere responds dramatically (∼2.5 min 1/e rise time) to the x-ray and EUV input by an abrupt increase in total electron content (TEC). The Oct 28 TEC ionospheric peak enhancement at the subsolar point is ∼25 TECU (25 ×1012 electrons/cm2) or 30% above background. In comparison, the Nov 4, Oct 29 and the Bastille Day events have ∼5--7 TECU peak enhancements above background. The Oct 28 TEC enhancement lasts ∼3 hrs, far longer than the flare duration. This latter ionospheric feature is consistent with increased electron production in the middle altitude ionosphere, where recombination rates are low. It is the EUV portion of the flare spectrum that is responsible for photoionization of this region. Further modeling will be necessary to fully understand the detailed physics and chemistry of flare-ionosphere coupling.},

The structure was identified in the airglow images of OI (630.0 nm and 777.4 nm) as NW-SE band structures (horizontal wavelength: 230 km) moving southwestward with a velocity of 50 m/s. Neutral wind velocity was measured simultaneously from the Doppler shift of the 630.0-nm emission by a Fabry-Perot interferometer at Shigaraki. From these parameters, we performed model calculations of MSTIDs generated by gravity waves and by an oscillating electric field. We found that for the case of gravity waves, the estimated vertical wavelength was too small to explain the observed amplitudes of airglow intensity. For the case of the electric field, we found that an electric field oscillation of ∼1.2 mV/m was sufficient to reproduce the observed airglow amplitudes. This modeled electric field was comparable to that observed by the DMSP F15 satellite as it passed over Shigaraki during our observing period on 17 May 2001. The DMSP ion drift data show that the oscillation of the polarization electric field correlated with the MSTID structure in the airglow image, suggesting that the polarization electric field plays an important role in the generation of MSTIDs.},

@article{Liou2000,
   abstract = {Impulsive Pi2 pulsations have long been recognized as one of the key signatures of magnetic activity during substorm periods due to their wide observable range both in latitudes and longitudes. It is well documented that there is usually more than one Pi2 wave burst associated with a substorm and only one of them corresponds to the onset of the substorm. This observational fact poses obstacles to determining substorm onsets with Pi2 signals. Although the Pi2 have become one of the most popular indicators for substorm onsets, the reliability of using the Pi2 in this fashion has not been seriously investigated. In this paper we address this question with a statistical approach by using \&\{\#\}8764;650 auroral substorm onsets identified with Polar ultraviolet images for a time interval from April 1996 to May 1997. A comparison of the low-latitude Pi2 pulsation onsets from Kakioka (L = 1.07) with the auroral breakups indicates that identifying substorm onset with the Pi2 alone is often ambiguous. Of a total of 119 isolated (defined as \&\{\#\}8764;10 min of quiet time preceding the onset) Pi2 bursts seen within \&\{\#\}8764;10 min from a magnetic positive bay, there were 65 events (\&\{\#\}8764;55%) taking place within 3 min from breakups and 34 events (29%) indicating no sign of an auroral breakup within 10 min of the Pi2 burst. This result suggests that Pi2 may not be as a good indicator of the substorm onset as it was thought to be. Interestingly, it is always possible to associate Pi2 pulsations with some forms of auroral intensification. When compared to auroral breakups, Pi2 onsets are subject to a small delay of 1 \&\{\#\}8211; 3 min, with a peak around l min. Delays of Pi2 onsets are revealed to be a function of location relative to auroral breakup. This dependence is found to be consistent with the time of flight for a fast-mode wave, in a plasmapause cavity mode model, propagating in the magnetosphere.},

   abstract = {During geomagnetic storms the ability of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) to measure ionospheric convection becomes limited when the radars suffer from absorption and the auroral disturbance expands equatorward of the radar sites. To overcome these shortcomings, it was decided to construct a SuperDARN radar at middle latitudes on the grounds of the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of Doppler measurements from the Wallops radar, which commenced operations in May 2005. Wallops measurements are compared with the Goose Bay radar during the onset of a geomagnetic storm on 31 August 2005: Goose Bay measured the onset of geomagnetic activity at high latitude while Wallops monitored the expansion of convection to middle latitudes. Average convection patterns binned by the Kp geomagnetic index are also presented. During weak-moderate geomagnetic activity (Kp \&\{\#\}8804; 3) the Wallops radar observes ionospheric irregularities between 50∞and 60∞magnetic latitude drifting westward across much of the nightside. When these measurements are incorporated into the calculation of an average SuperDARN convection pattern, the streamlines of polar cap outflow on the nightside become kinked in a manner reminiscent of the Harang discontinuity. This morphology arises quite naturally when the two-cell convection at high latitudes merges with the prevailing westward convection at middle latitudes. During increased geomagnetic activity (Kp \&\{\#\}8805; 3), Wallops is able to measure the expansion of auroral electric fields to middle latitudes and the average SuperDARN cross-polar cap potential is increased by 25%.},

This paper examines two aspects of the absorption calculation that have not been as thoroughly investigated. First, the correct method to calculate ionospheric absorption is explored; while the Sen Wyller ray trace formulation is generally cited as the best approximation in the D- and E-regions of the ionosphere, the Appleton-Hartree formulation is more consistent with the theory in the F- region of the ionosphere. It is shown that either ray trace formulation can be used to calculate ionospheric absorption if the correct collision frequencies are utilized. Another frequently overlooked aspect of the attenuation calculation are the variations in the electron-neutral and electron-ion collision frequencies as a function of local time, season, latitude and solar cycle. These variations result in differences on the order of 30% in the total ionospheric attenuation and should be included in absorption calculations.},

Near these locations (on closed field lines), VLF and riometer signatures are observed to show effects of energetic particle precipitation in the morning sector (extending to the postdawn region), confirmed by observations at geosynchronous orbit. In the VLF data, both the initial injection as well as echoes are observed. The mechanism responsible for such high-latitude injections is thought to be a combination of dynamics of the injection process and drift-shell splitting.

   abstract = {The characteristics of mid-latitude Pi 2 pulsations are studied using a subauroral east-west chain of magnetometers which spans over 4 hours local magnetic time. The mid-latitude magnetic bays associated with the Pi 2 pulsations are used to define a longitudinal coordinate system based on the substorm current wedge model. The wave properties, frequency, polarization, and east-west phase variations are examined in this coordinate system. This allows us to compare the wave characteristics at longitudes between the meridians of the two field-aligned currents of the substorm current wedge with the characteristics both east and west of these meridians. In an attempt to minimize the influence of preexisting current systems on our estimate of the substorm current location we use only Pi 2 pulsations which follow a magnetically quiet interval and which start simultaneously with a magnetic bay. We find that the longitudinal pattern of the horizontal polarization ellipse azimuth found earlier extends beyond the meridians of the field-aligned currents. The sense of wave horizontal polarization is predominantly counterclockwise at all longitudes, though the incidence of linear and clockwise polarization increases with distance from the field-aligned current meridians. Estimates of signal phase differences between station pairs, if interpreted as azimuthal phase propagation, show that westward propagation dominates west of and within the field-aligned current meridians but the eastward propagation dominates east of the current system. This latter observation fits a recent model introduced to explain the longitudinal variation in polarization azimuth. We also looked for variations in the signal frequency among stations and found some variation in about half the events studied but could find no systematic behavior.},

   abstract = {Using the hourly mean AE indices for the past 20 years, amounting to a total of 175,296 hours, we examine how the longitudinal station gaps of the present AE network affect the ability to monitor accurately the auroral electrojets. The latitudinal shift of the auroral electrojet location with magnetic activity also affects the reliability of the AE indices. These combined effects would result in pronounced universal time (UT) variations of the AE indices. By counting the number of occurrences recorded during the given ranges of activity, say every 100 and 200 nT for the AU and AL indices, respectively, for each hour of universal time, the UT variations of the two indices are examined separately. The result demonstrates clearly that they are strongly dependent upon UT. Furthermore, it is noted that the equatorward expansion of the auroral electrojets is more responsible for the UT variation than are the longitudinal station gaps. For the range of the magnetic activity levels examined in this study, i.e., 0 to 500 nT and 0 to \&\{\#\}8722;1000 nT for the AU and AL indices, the centers of the eastward and westward electrojets seem to be located within the latitudinal ranges of 71∞\&\{\#\}8211;65∞and 68∞\&\{\#\}8211;62∞, respectively. The seasonal change of ionospheric conductance also contributes to the UT variation, particularly that of the AL index. While maintaining a similar variation pattern, the amplitude of the variation increases during winter and decreases during summer. It indicates that the UT variation of the AL index is more serious during winter than summer. With more AE stations being located within the former range than the latter, it is easily understood why the AL index is more strongly dependent on UT than is the AU index. Considering such a latitudinal distribution, it is highly probable that the present AL indices often underestimate disturbed conditions during specific universal time intervals, particularly 0200\&\{\#\}8211;0800 UT.},

@article{Kirchengast1997,
   abstract = {The high-latitude ionosphere is a physically complex regime where traveling ionospheric disturbance signatures (TIDs) are caused not only by atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) but also by other processes. Among these, wavelike variations in E × B drift strength, particle precipitation intensity, and ionospheric return current density are the most relevant ones; they can produce TIDs similar to AGW/TIDs (typical periods around 1 hour), frequently seen, for example, in incoherent scatter (IS) data. This study is concerned with elucidating the characteristics of TIDs from these different mechanisms in the high-latitude F region, aiming at three major aspects: (1) the causative mechanism-TID relationship, (2) the interpretation of TIDs in ionospheric data, especially IS data, in terms of causative mechanisms, and (3) the reliable recognition of AGW-induced TIDs, which are of special interest. To study these aspects tailored to IS data exploitation, theoretical simulations of TIDs were performed for representative cases of the causative mechanisms, utilizing a realistic ionospheric model (``Graz Ionospheric Flux Tube Simulation (GIFTS) model'') which self-consistently yields the fundamental TID quantities, electron density, ion drift, ion and electron temperature, and further mechanism-dependent quantities. The physical understanding of the non-AGW/TIDs could be significantly improved. A general finding was that because of nonlinear processes (e.g., frictional heating) and its coupling to the thermosphere, the ionosphere is capable of generating complicated TID waveforms (e.g., a dominant second harmonic) even for a monochromatic source mechanism. TID information derivable from IS data was found sufficiently unique for each mechanism to allow its identification. In particular, the unique features of AGW/TIDs allow their reliable recognition among other TIDs. The results provide a good basis for future automation of the recognition and quantification of causative mechanisms based on IS data.},

   abstract = {The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) thermospheric general circulation model (TGCM) is used to calculate the time-dependent thermospheric response to the May 30, 1984, annular solar eclipse. The path of maximum obscurity begins at sunrise in the Pacific Ocean near 2$\,^\{\circ\}$N and 135$\,^\{\circ\}$W. It moves northeastward, passing across central Mexico, the eastern United States, and then the Atlantic before ending near 28$\,^\{\circ\}$N and 4$\,^\{\circ\}$E in Algeria. The area of the partial shadow is relatively large, and the total solar flux incident on the dayside of the earth is decreased by about 6% during the eclipse. The TGCM calculates the time-dependent response of the winds, temperature, and the mass mixing ratios of the major constituents throughout the thermosphere. Perturbations follow the path of the annular eclipse, with maximum deviations occurring near 1700 UT at about 300 km for the temperature and at higher altitudes for the winds and composition. The perturbation winds converge from all directions toward the shadow at speeds reaching 75 m s−1 in the upper thermosphere. The maximum temperature anomaly (−55 K) and vertical wind anomaly (−7 m s−1) occur near the center of the shadow. At a constant altitude of 300 km, both the N2 density and the O density decrease by about 10% and 6%, respectively. The path of maximum obscuration passes within 3$\,^\{\circ\}$of latitude of the incoherent scatter radar at Millstone Hill, Massachusetts (42.6$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 71.5$\,^\{\circ\}$W). The station experiences a maximum solar obscuration of 86% at 1700 UT (1200 LT). A time-dependent one-dimensional numerical model of the ionosphere that uses the TGCM-calculated winds, temperature, and composition at Millstone Hill is used to calculate the electron and ion densities and temperatures and the densities of the odd-nitrogen species NO, N(4S), and N(²D) during the eclipse. The calculated electron density decreases by about factors of 2 in the F region, 4 in the F1 region, and 3 in the E region compared to a similar control run without an eclipse. The F1 region emerges during the eclipse with an increase in the NO+/O+ ratio. The calculated electron temperature decreases by 460 K during the eclipse but then increases 200 K following the eclipse because of the intense solar heating in a region of reduced electron densities. The calculated ion temperature generally follows the changes in neutral temperature. The calculated thermospheric and ionospheric responses agree well with measurements made by the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar.},

  abstract = {Ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of ionospheric total electron content (TEC) show variations consistent with atmospheric internal gravity waves caused by ocean tsunamis following two recent seismic events: the Samoa earthquake of 29 September 2009 and the Chile earthquake of 27 February 2010. Both earthquakes produced ocean tsunamis that were destructive to coastal communities near the epicenters, and both were observed in tidal gauge and buoy measurements throughout the Pacific Ocean. We observe fluctuations in TEC correlated in time, space, and wave properties with these tsunamis using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Global Ionospheric Mapping software. These TEC measurements were band-pass filtered to remove ionospheric TEC variations with wavelengths and periods outside the typical range for tsunamis. Observable variations in TEC appear correlated with the tsunamis in some locations (Hawaii and Japan), but not in others (Southern California or near the epicenters). Where variations are observed, the typical amplitude tends to be ∼0.1--0.2 TEC units for these events, on the order of ∼1% of the background TEC value. These observations are compared to estimates of expected tsunami-driven TEC variations produced by Embry Riddle Aeronautical University's Spectral Full Wave Model, an atmosphere-ionosphere coupled model, and are found to be in good agreement. Significant TEC variations are not always seen when a tsunami is present, but in these two events the regions where a strong ocean tsunami was observed coincided with clear TEC observations, while a lack of clear TEC observations coincided with smaller sea surface height amplitudes. There exists the potential to apply these detection techniques to real-time GPS TEC data, providing estimates of tsunami speed and amplitude that may be useful for early warning systems.},

   abstract = {In this paper we review the theory of acoustic-gravity waves, the interaction of such waves with the ionosphere, the experimental support for the existence of such waves in the upper atmosphere, and the role played by acoustic-gravity waves in thermospheric dynamics. After a thorough discussion on the properties of acoustic-gravity waves in an ideal isothermal atmosphere, the effects produced by horizontal winds, sharp boundary discontinuities, and dissipative processes are discussed. The generation of these waves by stationary or moving sources is then treated. It is shown that the atmospheric response to a stationary impulse source can be described by the emission of three waves: acoustic, buoyancy, and gravity. These discussions are then followed by reviewing propagation effects in a realistic atmosphere for both free waves and guided waves. Recent numerical results are given. When acoustic-gravity waves propagate through the ionosphere, interaction between the wave and the ionosphere will take place. The physical processes involved in such an interaction are examined. The response of the ionosphere to acoustic-gravity waves can be fairly complex, but its understanding is necessary to interpret various experimental data. The existing experimental data on traveling disturbances are then reviewed. The existence of acoustic-gravity waves throughout the atmosphere implies coupling between the lower atmosphere and the upper atmosphere. Transport of both momentum and energy are accompanied by the wave process. The implication of momentum and energy transport on thermospheric dynamics is discussed.},

   abstract = {In this paper we present the detailed results of a series of experiments designed to study the coherent backscatter of 50-MHz radar waves from the mid-latitude F region. Data were obtained with the active phased-array MU radar in Japan and include some auxiliary E region coherent echoes as well. As in other turbulent ionospheric phenomena the intense nonthermal scatter comes from irregularities oriented parallel to B. The strongest echoes correspond to irregularities at least 20 dB stronger than thermal backscatter at the same frequency from typical F region densities at the same range. Simultaneous observations with ionosondes show that these echoes occur during strong mid-latitude spread F. As defined by ionosondes, the latter phenomenon is certainly much more widespread than the turbulent upwelling events described here, but we believe that in some sense these correspond to the most violent mid-latitude spread F. The strongest echoes occur in large patches which display away Doppler shifts corresponding to irregularity motion upward and northward from the radar. At the edges of these patches there is often a brief period of toward Doppler before the echoing region ceases. On rare occasions comparable patches of strong away and toward Doppler are detected, although in such cases the Doppler width of the toward echoes is much narrower than that of the away echoes. The away patches often are characterized by mean velocities well over 250 m/s and Doppler widths (full width at half maximum) of 50 m/s. The multiple beam capability at MU allowed us to track the patches in the zonal direction on two days. The patches moved east to west in both cases at velocities of 125 m/s and 185 m/s, respectively. There is a distinct tendency for the bottom contour of the scattering region to be modulated at the same period as the patch occurrence frequency as well as at higher frequencies. This higher-frequency component may correspond to substructures in the large patches and to the E region coherent scatter patches which were detected simultaneously in several multiple beam experiments. In the companion paper (Kelley and Fukao, this issue), we explore a number of possible explanations for this phenomenon in more detail.},

   abstract = {As a contribution to the International Magnetospheric Study (IMS, 1976--1979) a two-dimensional array of 42 temporary magnetometer stations was run in Scandinavia, supplementary to the permanent observatories and concentrated in the northern part of the region. This effort aimed at the time-dependent (periods above about 100 s) determination of the two-dimensional structure of substorm-related magnetic fields at the Earth's surface with highest reasonable spatial resolution (about 100 km, corresponding to the height of the ionosphere) near the footpoints of field-aligned electric currents that couple the disturbed magnetosphere to the ionosphere at auroral latitudes. It has been of particular advantage for cooperative studies that not only simultaneous data were available from all-sky cameras, riometers, balloons, rockets, and satellites, but also from the STARE radar facility yielding colocated two-dimensional ionospheric electric field distributions. In many cases it therefore was possible to infer the three-dimensional regional structure of substorm-related ionospheric current systems. The first part of this review outlines the basic relationships and methods that have been used or have been developed for such studies. The second short part presents typical equivalent current patterns observed by the magnetometer array in the course of substorms. Finally we review main results of studies that have been based on the magnetometer array observations and on additional data, omitting studies on geomagnetic pulsations. These studies contributed to a clarification of the nature of auroral electrojets including the Harang discontinuity and of ionospheric current systems related to auroral features such as the break-up at midnight, the westward traveling surge, eastward drifting omega bands, and spirals.},

   abstract = {The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is the fifth NASA Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX), launched on February 17, 2007 to determine the trigger and large-scale evolution of substorms. The mission employs five identical micro-satellites (hereafter termed probes ) which line up along the Earth's magnetotail to track the motion of particles, plasma and waves from one point to another and for the first time resolve space--time ambiguities in key regions of the magnetosphere on a global scale. The probes are equipped with comprehensive in-situ particles and fields instruments that measure the thermal and super-thermal ions and electrons, and electromagnetic fields from DC to beyond the electron cyclotron frequency in the regions of interest. The primary goal of THEMIS, which drove the mission design, is to elucidate which magnetotail process is responsible for substorm onset at the region where substorm auroras map (∼10 RE): (i) a local disruption of the plasma sheet current (current disruption) or (ii) the interaction of the current sheet with the rapid influx of plasma emanating from reconnection at ∼25 RE. However, the probes also traverse the radiation belts and the dayside magnetosphere, allowing THEMIS to address additional baseline objectives, namely: how the radiation belts are energized on time scales of 2--4 hours during the recovery phase of storms, and how the pristine solar wind's interaction with upstream beams, waves and the bow shock affects Sun--Earth coupling. THEMIS's open data policy, platform-independent dataset, open-source analysis software, automated plotting and dissemination of data within hours of receipt, dedicated ground-based observatory network and strong links to ancillary space-based and ground-based programs. promote a grass-roots integration of relevant NASA, NSF and international assets in the context of an international Heliophysics Observatory over the next decade. The mission has demonstrated spacecraft and mission design strategies ideal for Constellation-class missions and its science is complementary to Cluster and MMS. THEMIS, the first NASA micro-satellite constellation, is a technological pathfinder for future Sun-Earth Connections missions and a stepping stone towards understanding Space Weather.},

@article{Hallinan2001,
   abstract = {Abstract Auroral acceleration is usually conceived in terms of measured electron energy-spectra and pitch-angle distributions. But another historical thread draws upon studies of auroral morphology. By 1970 it had been discovered that the rays in active rayed arcs are actually arrays of vortices similar to those observed in fluid shear and in laboratory experiments involving magnetized sheet electron beams (Kelvin-Helmholtz instability). The apparent shear flow implied that rays drift at the E X B velocity in a convergent electric field of the order of 1 v/m. But ionospheric electric fields rarely exceeded 100 mV/m. A suggested solution, that the electric fields existed in the source region but did not map down to the lower ionosphere, required that there be an upward electric field in the center of the arc. This field would accelerate electrons downward into the ionosphere. To compare electric fields inferred from inverted V energy with those inferred from ray motions requires a fortunate conjunction of a rocket or satellite passing through an overhead rayed arc. The AMICIST payload provided such an opportunity and the inferred fields were consistent. Morphology studies also show that clockwise spirals, associated with upward currents and counter-clockwise curls, associated with charge sheets, have scale-sizes differing by two orders of magnitude. This suggests that current sheets have thickness of order 50 km (multiple arc) while negative charge tends to be concentrated in thin layers of order 500m (arc elements). This difference needs to be considered in relating parallel fields to Birkeland currents. Finally, conjugate studies of auroras suggest that the potential contours close somewhere above the acceleration region rather than in the conjugate ionosphere. This raises the question of how electrons are forced into the regions of high negative potential.},

  abstract = {Plasma density structures and associated irregularities in the nighttime midlatitude ionosphere are frequently observed as frontal structures elongated from northwest to southeast (NW-SE) in the Northern Hemisphere. The frontal structures and the coupling process between the E and F regions are studied with a three-dimensional numerical model, which can simulate two instability mechanisms: Perkins instability in the F-region and sporadic-E (Es)-layer instability in the E region. The fastest growth of the coupled instability occurs when the unstable conditions on NW-SE perturbation are satisfied in both regions. The perturbation of F-region integrated conductivity grows much faster than the isolated Perkins instability. The meridional component of a rotational wind shear blows an existing Es layer southward, and the F-region structure follows the E-region drift velocity. The NW-SE structure in the E region can be formed from random perturbation regardless of the F-region condition. When the F region is unstable on the NW-SE perturbation, however, the NW-SE structure is formed in both regions with a common scale length. We conclude that (1) the Es-layer instability plays a major role in seeding NW-SE structure in the F region, and the Perkins instability is required to amplify its perturbation; (2) the rotational wind shear in the E region produces southwestward phase propagation of the NW-SE structure in both the E and F regions; and (3) the coupling process has a significant effect on the scale of the Es-layer perturbation rather than the growth rate of the Es-layer instability.},

At a Pi2 onset of August 14, 1996, the GEOTAIL satellite and the GOES8 geosynchronous satellite were aligned in the X direction observing transient signatures. Those signatures were examined by referring to a ground low-latitude Pi2 wave detected at the same meridian as GOES8. In the present event, a BBF started prior to the ground Pi2 onset, but it was preceded by a Pi2 onset at GOES8. It is also found that ground Pi2 signatures were correlated much better with geosynchronous Pi2 signatures than with perturbations of the plasma sheet flow velocity measured at GEOTAIL. These results strongly suggest that the BBF was not the cause of the low-latitude Pi2 observed in the present event.},

   abstract = {From January 1971 to March 1973, five satellites of the Navy Navigation Series (Transit) in polar orbits at 1000 km altitude were tracked from Millstone Hill to secure differential-Doppler measurements of N-S gradients in the ionosphere. In all, over 2000 passes were observed, encompassing all local times and seasons. All of the differential-Doppler records have been scanned to secure statistical information on the incidence, wavelength, amplitude, and location of the traveling ionospheric disturbances detected. Most of the TID's had wavelengths in the range of 150--350 km and were seen to the south of the station, suggesting that they were traveling from north to south. The incidence peaked at 60% of all passes at 0800 local time and dropped to less than 5% for a few hours before sunrise. The seasonal variation is less clear-cut, but the incidence seems to be increased in winter and the equinoxes and reduced in summer. This may be simply a consequence of the dependence of the detectability on total content. While the character of the fluctuations and a north-to-south motion would be consistent with a source in the auroral ionosphere, there seems to be no increase in incidence during magnetically disturbed times. Moreover, in summer the waves are seen equally to the north and the south of the station. It seems possible that there may be many sources for these waves distributed in latitude and that the observed locations are controlled by the filtering effects of F region winds.},

Using the MSIS86 thermospheric model to relate the heights hmF2 to values of atmospheric pressure, the F2-peak is found to lie at nearly the same pressure-level at any given local time, over a wide range of geophysical conditions (season, solar cycle, magnetic disturbance). As local time varies, the pressure level corresponding to hmF2 varies in a way that is mainly determined by the local time variation of the thermospheric winds. This is verified for noon and midnight, using the MSIS86 model to compute the winds. The noon values of peak electron density (NmF2) are fairly consistent with theory (using values of solar ionizing flux as quoted in the literature), but with some discrepancies---particularly at sunspot maximum---that are probably due to uncertainties in chemical composition, or to the effects of vibrational excitation of molecular nitrogen. Overall, the analysis shows a remarkable consistency between ionospheric theory, the data and the MSIS model.},

   abstract = {We study mechanisms contributing to proton precipitation from the ring current during the May 14--16, 1997, geomagnetic storm. This storm was caused partly by Bz< 0 fields in the sheath region behind an interplanetary shock and partly by the magnetic cloud driving the shock. The storm was characterized by a maximum Kp=7− and a minimum Dst=−115 nT and had a distinctive two-phase decay related to the passage of the ejection at the Earth. We model the ring current development caused by adiabatic drifts and losses due to charge exchange, Coulomb collisions, wave-particle interactions, and atmospheric collisions at low altitudes. The nightside magnetospheric inflow is simulated using geosynchronous Los Alamos National Laboratory data, whereas the dayside free outflow corresponds to losses through the dayside magnetopause. We calculate the equatorial growth rate of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves with frequencies between the oxygen and helium gyrofrequencies and their integrated wave gain as the storm progresses. The regions of maximum wave amplification compare reasonably well to satellite observations. A time-dependent global wave model is constructed, and the spatial and temporal evolution of precipitating proton fluxes during different storm phases is determined. We find that the global patterns of proton precipitation are very dynamic: located at larger L shells during prestorm conditions, moving to lower L shells as geomagnetic activity increases during storm main phase, and receding back toward larger L shells with storm recovery. However, the most intense fluxes are observed along the duskside plasmapause during the main and early recovery phase of the storm and are caused by plasma wave scattering. This study is relevant to the analysis of the anticipated new data sets from the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) and Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED) missions.},

So far they have been basically studied at mid latitude and for limited periods (less than few years) at solar maximum conditions. This extension has been possible due to the availability of local Global Positioning System (GPS) networks at mid-north hemisphere (California), mid-south hemisphere (New Zealand), high and low latitudes (Alaska and Hawaii), for the last 13, 11, 7 and 4 years respectively. Optimal algorithms specially suitable for mass data processing have been used, such as the Single Receiver Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric activity index (SRMTID) and the phase difference method for MSTID propagation estimation. The results reveal that several of the main MSTID climatological trends at mid latitude are also shared at low and high latitude, also modulated in intensity also by the Solar Cycle. This is the case for local fall/winter day-time equatorward propagated MSTIDs with typical velocities and wavelengths of 150--250 m/s and 100--300 km respectively. Moreover the comparison of MSTID propagation estimation using different techniques, and their implications in terms of potential origins of MSTIDs, are also discussed.},

The magnitude of ionospheric anomalies in both vertical drifts and TEC is comparable to the anomalies observed during the record-strong SSW of January 2009 that coincided with the extreme solar minimum. This observation contrasts with results of numerical simulations that predict weaker ionospheric response to the tidal forcing during high solar activity.},

HF Doppler sounders together with modern data analysis techniques can provide comprehensive traveling ionospheric disturbance (TID) characteristics, including both horizontal and vertical TID velocities and wavelengths across the entire spectrum from periods of 1 min to over an hour. Atmospheric and Space Technology Research Associates LLC has developed a new system called ``TIDDBIT'' (TID Detector Built in Texas), and data will be presented from a TIDDBIT system deployed in Virginia. These results reinforce the relationship between atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) and TIDs. The TID propagation azimuths rotate through 360$\,^\{\circ\}$ in 24 h, mimicking the rotation of the thermospheric winds but with approximately a 90$\,^\{\circ\}$ offset. The rotation of TID azimuths and thermospheric winds in Virginia is similar to that observed previously by other Northern Hemisphere systems and opposite from the direction observed in Antarctica. These results illustrate the filtering effects that thermospheric neutral winds can have on the propagation of AGW. The completeness of the wave information obtained from the TIDDBIT system makes it possible to reconstruct the vertical displacement of isoionic contours over the ∼200 km horizontal dimension of the sounder array. Such information will be relevant for understanding the seeding of irregularities, as well as for several operational needs involving navigation, communication, and surveillance systems.},

  abstract = {Wave-like disturbances in electron density ne have been observed in the thermosphere above Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico throughout its 45 year history. However, only recently has it become evident that these waves are continuously present in the Arecibo thermosphere. The wave characteristics are fairly constant between day and night and from season to season. High-resolution electron density measurements obtained by applying the coded long-pulse radar technique to photoelectron-enhanced Langmuir waves are presented. These new observations strongly suggest that the perturbations in electron density are the result of internal acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) propagating through the Arecibo thermosphere. The AGWs appear to be broadbanded in wave number space. The downward phase trajectories of Δne/ne between 400 and 120 km combined with the low horizontal phase velocities obtained from airglow measurements support the idea that the AGWs are not ducted but rather are locally produced. In addition, the altitudes at which major peaks in Δne/ne are observed follow theoretical estimates for nonducted waves. The nominal period of the AGWs is ∼60 min at 250 km altitude, but periods of ∼20 min are also evident at lower attitudes. Classic sources of AGWs do not appear to be consistent with the Arecibo observations of a continuous flux of background AGWs. Ray tracing of the AGWs combined with 630.0 nm airglow observations point to a source location in the Atlantic Ocean that is roughly 2100 km east northeast of Arecibo. Internal ocean waves generated in response to the internal tide at the mid-Atlantic Ridge are the most likely source of Arecibo's thermospheric AGWs.},

In middle latitudes the winter midnight thickness is essentially independent of the flux, whereas in summer and equinox the midnight thickness increases with increase of solar flux.

The zero-order Fourier coefficients for the diurnal curves at all 15 stations were expressed as linear functions of the 10.7-cm flux.

  abstract = {Abstract~~The NASA Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) project is intended to investigate magnetospheric substorm phenomena, which are the manifestations of a basic instability of the magnetosphere and a dominant mechanism of plasma transport and explosive energy release. The major controversy in substorm science is the uncertainty as to whether the instability is initiated near the Earth, or in the more distant &gt;20 Re magnetic tail. THEMIS will discriminate between the two possibilities by using five in-situ satellites and ground-based all-sky imagers and magnetometers, and inferring the propagation direction by timing the observation of the substorm initiation at multiple locations in the magnetosphere. An array of stations, consisting of 20 all-sky imagers (ASIs) and 30-plus magnetometers, has been developed and deployed in the North American continent, from Alaska to Labrador, for the broad coverage of the nightside magnetosphere. Each ground-based observatory (GBO) contains a white light imager that takes auroral images at a 3-second repetition rate (‚Äúcadence‚Äù) and a magnetometer that records the 3 axis variation of the magnetic field at 2&nbsp;Hz frequency. The stations return compressed images, ‚Äúthumbnails,‚Äù to two central databases: one located at UC Berkeley and the other at the University of Calgary, Canada. The full images are recorded at each station on hard drives, and these devices are physically returned to the two data centers for data copying. All data are made available for public use by scientists in ‚Äúbrowse products,‚Äù accessible by using internet browsers or in the form of downloadable CDF data files (the ‚Äúbrowse products‚Äù are described in detail in a later section). Twenty all-sky imager stations are installed and running at the time of this publication. An example of a substorm was observed on the 23rd of December 2006, and from the THEMIS GBO data, we found that the substorm onset brightening of the equatorward arc was a gradual process (&gt;27&nbsp;seconds), with minimal morphology changes until the arc breaks up. The breakup was timed to the nearest frame (&lt;3&nbsp;s) and located to the nearest latitude degree at about ¬$\pm$3oE in longitude. The data also showed that a similar breakup occurred in Alaska ‚àº10 minutes later, highlighting the need for an array to distinguish prime onset.},

Earthward BBFs are more frequent close to midnight and away from Earth, up to a distance of \&\{\#\}8764;19 RE. Tailward BBFs are very infrequent in the IRM data set and somewhat less infrequent in the ISEE 2 data set in the region of the satellites' spatial overlap, possibly due to the more active conditions prevailing during the ISEE 2 mission in that region. However, in both data sets the ratio of tailward to earthward BBFs increases with distance from Earth; more than 20% of all BBFs are anti-sunward tailward of X = \&\{\#\}8722;19 RE in the ISEE 2 data set. BBFs are responsible for 60-100% of the measured earthward transport of mass, energy and magnetic flux past the satellite in the regions of maximum occurrence rate, even though they last approximately 10-15% of the IPS observation time there. Thus BBFs represent the primary transport mechanism at those regions. The one-to-one correspondence between BBFs and substorm phase, as well as the relative contribution of BBFs to the total transport observed during substorms are questions that await further investigation based on multi instrument studies of individual events.},

  abstract = {Using empirical magnetospheric models, we study the relative contribution from different current systems to the SYM and ASY midlatitude indices. It was found that the models can reproduce ground-based midlatitude indices with correlation coefficients between the model and real indices being ∼0.8--0.9 for SYM-H and ∼0.6--0.8 and ∼0.5--0.7 for ASY-H and ASY-D, respectively. The good agreement between the indices computed using magnetospheric models and real ones indicates that purely ionospheric current systems, on average, give modest contribution to these indices. The superposed epoch analysis of the indices computed using the models shows that, nominally, the cross-tail current gives the dominant contribution to SYM-H index during the main phase. However, it should be remembered that the model region 2, partial ring current, and cross-tail current systems are not spatially demarcated (the systems are overlapped in the vicinity of geostationary orbit). For this reason, this result should be taken with a precaution. The relative contribution from symmetric ring current to SYM-H starts to increase a bit prior or just after SYM-H minimum and attains its maximum during recovery phase. The ASY-H and ASY-D indices are controlled by interplay between three current systems which close via the ionosphere. The region 1 FAC gives the largest contribution to ASY-H and ASY-D indices during the main phase, though, region 2 FAC and partial ring current contributions are also prominent. In addition, we discuss the application of these results to resolving the long-debated inconsistencies of the substorm-controlled geomagnetic storm scenario.},

   abstract = {We investigate in detail the time history of substorm disturbances in the magnetotail observed during a major tail conjunction of Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) satellites on 29 January 2008, 0700--0900 UT. During this interval, all THEMIS satellites were closely aligned along the tail axis near midnight and were bracketed in local time by GOES 11 and 12. The radial distance covered ranges from the geosynchronous altitude to ∼30 R E in the tail. This interval consists of three activations detected by the THEMIS satellites with good ground all-sky-camera observations of auroral activity. The first activation is a small substorm with spatially limited disturbance in the tail. The onset arc was equatorward of an undisturbed arc. The second activation is a moderate size substorm with the onset arc also being equatorward of an undisturbed arc. The third activation is an intensification of the substorm with its onset indicated by the second activation. The active auroral arc for this intensification was near the poleward boundary of the auroral oval. Analysis of these observations indicates that the first activation is a small substorm initiated in the near-Earth plasma sheet and does not involve magnetic reconnection of open magnetic field lines. Magnetic reconnection on closed field lines can be ruled out for this substorm because it cannot generate the observed high-speed plasma flow. The second and third activations are part of a moderate size substorm initiated also in the near-Earth plasma sheet, with a subsequent substorm intensification involving activity initiated tailward of ∼30 R E . Overall, the time history of substorm activity for these two substorms is consistent with the near-Earth initiation model.},

   abstract = {High time resolution measurements of magnetic and electric fields and of the kiloelectronvolt electron flux at X −21 Re in the central magnetotail were used in the study of short-duration (time scale 1 min) magnetic field events during two consecutive substorms on 23 March 1979. These events were observed at ISEE-1 and 2 (having 0.3 Re separation along the Z-coordinate), both inside and outside of the thinned plasma sheet, close (in time) to the polarity reversal of the plasma flow from tailward to earthward direction in association with the transient plasma sheet expansions. The enhanced magnetic flux closure (southward Bz during tailward streaming events, northward during earthward streaming events), plus enhanced plasma flow during these events, suggest that they are nightside magnetic flux transfer events (NFTEs). The typical behaviour of the magnetic field during a NFTE (compression, rotation then field decrease), the signatures of overpressure in such structures and their close correlation with ground-based observed auroral activations and high energy particle bursts signify that NFTE structures may result from the impulsive reconnection in the plasmasheet. Systematic differences in the magnetic variations found at ISEE-1 and 2 indicate current concentration at the outer plasmasheet boundary during the passage of a NFTE. Two NFTEs appeared to have structures similar to magnetic flux ropes. The NFTE structure and associated current system, as well as the interpretation of NFTE signatures in terms of the impulsive reconnection, are discussed. During the ``poleward leap'' stage of one substorm, the spacecraft within the central part of the plasma sheet observed the intense earthward magnetic flux transport associated with superimposed NFTE structures. The estimated amount of this flux transfer explained well the observed amplitude of the poleward expansion of the westward electrojet in the conjugate auroral zone.},

  abstract = {The study of solar flare effects (SFEs) on the ionosphere is having a renaissance. The development of GPS ground and satellite data for scientific use has opened up new means for high time resolution research on SFEs. At present, without continuous flare photon spectra (X rays, EUV, UV, and visible) monitoring instrumentation, the best way to model flare spectral changes within a flare is through ionospheric GPS studies. Flare EUV photons can increase the total electron content of the subsolar ionosphere by up to 30% in ∼5 min. Energetic particles (ions) of 10 keV to GeV energies are accelerated at the flare site. Electrons with energies up to several MeV are also created. A coronal mass ejection (CME) is launched from the Sun at the time of the flare. Fast interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) have upstream shocks which accelerate ions to ∼10 keV to ∼10 MeV. Both sources of particles, when magnetically connected to the Earth's magnetosphere, enter the magnetosphere and the high-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere. Those particles that precipitate into the ionosphere cause rapid increases in the polar atmospheric ionization, disruption of transpolar communication, and cause ozone destruction. Complicating the picture, when the ICME reaches the magnetosphere ∼1 to 4 days later, shock compression of the magnetosphere energizes preexisting 10--100 keV magnetospheric electrons and ions, causing precipitation into the dayside auroral zone (∼60$\,^\{\circ\}$--65$\,^\{\circ\}$ MLAT) ionospheres. Shock compression can also trigger supersubstorms in the magnetotail with concomitant energetic particle precipitation into the nightside auroral zones. If the interplanetary sheath or ICME magnetic fields are southwardly directed and last for several hours, a geomagnetic storm will result. A magnetic storm is characterized by the formation of an unstable ring current with energetic particles in the range ∼10 keV to ∼500 keV. The ring current decays away by precipitation into the middle latitude ionosphere over timescales of ∼10 h. A schematic of a time line for the above SFE ionospheric effects is provided. Descriptions of where in the ionosphere and in what time sequence is provided in the body of the text. Much of the terminology presently in use describing solar, interplanetary, magnetospheric, and ionospheric SFE-related phenomena are dated. We suggest physics-based terms be used in the future.},

   note = {Although the mid-latitude thermosphere contains both neutral and plasma fluids, most studies of wave dynamics and instabilities in this region of the atmosphere had focused, until recently, on either neutral gravity waves or plasma instabilities to the exclusion of the other. As a result, there was little to draw attention to coupled mid-latitude physics when compared to the auroral and equatorial zones. In the past decade, however, an increasing array of remote sensing and in situ techniques have revealed new phenomena in the mid-latitude ionosphere which are dramatically challenging our current understanding. These experiments have revealed a growing awareness of the interconnections between gravity waves, traveling ionospheric disturbances, elongated bands of raised ionosphere, density depletions, and the recently discovered turbulent upwellings of mid-latitude plasma which, phenomenologically at least, are quite similar to their equatorial spread F cousins. At the same time, a renewed interest in theoretical and numerical investigations of mid-latitude physics is demonstrating the unique interaction of atmospheric dynamics and ionospheric electrodynamics which drives mid-latitude disturbances. In this paper, we describe the basic plasma physics of the mid-latitude ionosphere and its connections to both old and new observations; we end with some suggestions for the near term future of mid-latitude plasma research.},

For example, (1) occurrence of PP type of Pc1 even in the international Pc3 range (Heacock, 1966), (2) PP and CE getting mixed in a common period band (cf. 2.7), (3) similar mixing tendency of Pc3 with Pc4 (cf. 3.3 or Figure 21), (4) subtypes of Pi pulsations having common period ranges but different source mechanisms, (5) existence of various types of pulsations which can be classified neither to Pc nor to Pi (cf.

In recent years, SuperDARN has expanded to midlatitudes in order to provide enhanced coverage during geomagnetically active periods. A new type of backscatter from F region plasma irregularities with low Doppler velocity has been frequently observed on the nightside during quiescent conditions. Using three years of data from the Blackstone, VA radar, we have implemented a method for extracting this new type of backscatter from routine observations. We have statistically characterized the occurrence properties of the Sub Auroral Ionospheric Scatter (SAIS) events, including the latitudinal relationships to the equatorward edge of the auroral oval and the ionospheric projection of the plasmapause. We find that the backscatter is confined to local night, occurs on \&\{\#\}8776;70% of nights, is fixed in geomagnetic latitude, and is equatorward of both the auroral region and the plasmapause boundary. We conclude that SAIS irregularities are observed within a range of latitudes that is conjugate to the inner magnetosphere (plasmasphere).},

  abstract = {We present three case studies that examine optical and radar methods for specifying precipitating auroral flux parameters and conductances. Three events were chosen corresponding to moderate nonsubstorm auroral activity with 557.7 nm intensities greater than 1kR. A technique that directly fits the electron number density from a forward electron transport model to alternating code incoherent scatter radar data is presented. A method for determining characteristic energy using neutral temperature observations is compared against estimates from the incoherent scatter radar. These techniques are focused on line-of-sight observations that are aligned with the local geomagnetic field. Good agreement is found between the optical and incoherent scatter radar methods for estimates of the average energy, energy flux, and conductances. The Pedersen conductance predicted by Robinson et al. (1987) is in very good agreement with estimates calculated from the incoherent scatter radar observations. However, we present an updated form of the relation by Robinson et al. (1987), ΣH/ΣP=0.57〈E〉0.53, which was found to be more consistent with the incoherent scatter radar observations. These results are limited to similar auroral configurations as in these case studies. Case studies are presented that quantify auroral electron flux parameters and conductance estimates which can be used to specify the magnitude of energy dissipated within the ionosphere resulting from magnetospheric driving.},

An explanation for these components was proposed by Hines in his theory for internal atmospheric gravity waves in an isothermal medium. The isothermal theory is refined here to unify the treatment of acoustic, gravity, and evanescent waves in a gravitational atmosphere and to explain the physical processes behind these atmospheric motions. A technique is developed for the solution of the complete hydrodynamic equations that avoids the fatal difficulties normally caused by `Viscous waves' and their thermal counterpart. This technique is used to solve the general problem of gravity wave propagation in a realistic atmosphere for a wide range of wave parameters. The height of maximum wind amplitude and the fraction of reflected energy have been plotted from the results of these calculations. These maxima are also compared with simpler analytic approximations and experimental observations.},

   abstract = {Abstract The seasonal (wintertime) development of middle atmosphere circulation in opposite phases of the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) was simulated with a three-dimensional nonlinear numerical model. In the stratosphere, the effect of equatorial QBO was generally consistent with the extratropical QBO observed by Holton and Tan, namely, a stronger midwinter polar vortex in the westerly phase, and vice versa. However, the extratropical response to the QBO was sensitive to other factors such as mesospheric gravity wave drag and the amplitude of Rossby waves specified at the model's lower boundary. The extratropical QBO was realistic only when a drag parameterization was included and Rossby wave amplitudes lay in an intermediate range close to the observed. At somewhat stronger forcing, the model's response was largest in the mesosphere where (in this case) westerlies were stronger in the easterly phase of equatorial QBO. This was apparently due to a shielding effect. The theory of planetary wave?mean flow interaction suggests that the sensitivity to equatorial QBO should be greatest for wave forcings near a ?bifurcation? point. Below this threshold the stratosphere approaches radiative equilibrium, shutting off vertical propagation of planetary waves. Supercritical forcing leads to a major warming. The model's sensitivity to forcing, while consistent with this idea, was most apparent in perpetual solstice runs without parameterized wave drag. Seasonal integrations with wave drag produced a more realistic extratropical QBO, making the bifurcation less conspicuous.},

On the ground, dayside structured EMIC wave activity was observed by the CARISMA and STEP magnetometer arrays for several hours during the period of maximum compression. The EMIC waves were also registered by the Cluster satellites for half an hour, as they consecutively crossed the conjugate equatorial plasmasphere on their perigee passes at L ∼ 5. Simultaneously, conjugate to Cluster, NOAA 17 passed through field lines supporting EMIC wave activity and registered a localized enhancement of precipitating protons with energies >30 keV. Our observations suggest that generation of the EMIC waves and consequent loss of energetic protons may last for several hours while the magnetosphere remains compressed. The EMIC waves were confined to the outer plasmasphere region, just inside the plasmapause. Analysis of lower-frequency Pc5 waves observed both by the Cluster electron drift instrument (EDI) and fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) instruments and by the ground magnetometers show that the repetitive structure of EMIC wave packets observed on the ground cannot be explained by the ultra low frequency (ULF) wave modulation theory. However, the EMIC wave repetition period on the ground was close to the estimated field-aligned Alfvénic travel time. For a short interval of time, there was some evidence that EMIC wave packet repetition period in the source region was half of that on the ground, which further suggests bidirectional propagation of wave packets.},

We present observations from PFISR where we were able to resolve the three components of the k vector of a traveling ionospheric disturbance (TID), as well as the period. These measurements give insight into the atmospheric gravity wave (AGW)-TID relationship, allowing us to apply a recently developed dispersion relation for AGWs that includes the role of kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity, important effects in the upper atmosphere, without assumptions about horizontal wavelengths. The analysis indicates that for this particular case, the wave must have been propagating against a background wind of ∼125 m/s.

For every spiral we defined the time of occurrence, diameter, direction of motion, arid distance between the adjacent spirals (wavelength) in cases of spiral streets. The magnetic activity level was determined by using the magnetic north component (B x ) recorded at the ASC station and the local auroral electrojet index (IL index) computed by using the data from the IMAGE magnetometer network. The typical values of the diameter, wavelength, and ratio between diameter and wavelength were 25\&\{\#\}8211;75 km, 125-175 km, and 2\&\{\#\}8211;6, respectively. According to our ASC data set, spirals are more common in the magnetic postmidnight sector than previous satellite observations suggest. Spirals drift predominantly in the same direction as the large-scale ionospheric convection. Our observations of the average drift speed of spirals of 4 km/s are comparable to the corresponding values of other auroral small-scale structures. Statistical analysis revealed that spirals occur most frequently under magnetically quiet (IL \{$>$\} \&\{\#\}8722;200 nT) conditions, and thus they cannot always be considered as precursors of substorm activity.},

Probably the main reason for such large discrepancies is the unrealism of any existing treatment of above-the-MUF (maximum usable frequency) loss. A programme of measurements of HF signal and noise intensities on path lengths of 120-2300 km, primarily directed to the study of fading statistics, is providing information relevant to the determination of above-the-MUF loss, because constraints on the frequencies which could be transmitted resulted in the operating frequency equalling and exceeding the basic MUF on a significant number of occasions. The experimental data and the theory support the hypothesis that the main physical mechanism involved in above-the-MUF propagation is ground side-scatter, rather than ionospheric forward-scatter.<<ETX>>},

The model incorporates all of the features of the NCAR thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIE-GCM) but the lower boundary has been extended downward from 97 to 30 km (10 mb) and it includes the physical and chemical processes appropriate for the mesosphere and upper stratosphere.The first simulation used Rayleigh friction to represent gravity wave drag in the middle atmosphere and although it was able to close the mesospheric jets it severely damped the diurnal tide. Reduced Rayleigh friction allowed the tide to penetrate to thermospheric heights but did not close the jets. A gravity wave parameterization developed by Fritts and Lu (1993) allows both features to exist simultaneously with the structure of tides and mean flow dependent upon the strength of the gravity wave source, The model calculates a changing dynamic structure with the mean flow and diurnal tide dominant in the mesosphere, the in-situ generated semi-diurnal tide dominating the lower thermosphere and an in-situ generated diurnal tide in the upper thermosphere. The results also show considerable interaction between dynamics and composition, especially atomic oxygen between 85 and 120 km.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations are performed for a sudden stratosphere warming (SSW) under different atmospheric tide and planetary wave forcing conditions to investigate the tidal variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The influence of variability of different tides in the MLT on generating perturbations to the low latitude ionosphere is also investigated. Significant changes are found to occur in the migrating semidiurnal solar (SW2) and lunar (M2) tides as well as in the westward propagating nonmigrating semidiurnal tide with zonal wave number 1 (SW1). The changes in the zonal mean atmosphere that occur during SSWs lead to an enhancement in the SW2 and M2 tides. The vertical wavelength of the SW2 is also changed, resulting in phase variability in the SW2 at a constant altitude. Significant enhancements in the SW1 are found to occur only in the presence of additional planetary wave forcing, and this demonstrates that nonlinear planetary wave‒tide interactions lead to the enhanced SW1 during SSWs. The amplitude and phase variability of the SW2 is found to be capable of producing temporal variability in the vertical plasma drift velocity that is similar to the observed variability. Changes in the M2 during SSWs can contribute up to an additional ∼30% of the total ionosphere variability; however, the overall influence of the lunar tide is found to be dependent upon the phase of the moon relative to the timing of the SSW. Although the influence is relatively minor, the SW1 also contributes to the low latitude ionosphere variability during SSWs. The simulation results for the vertical plasma drift velocity and total electron content (TEC) further illustrate that significant longitude variability occurs in the ionosphere response to SSWs.},

In the absence of dissipation, a GW's vertical wavelength λz increases by , or greater if its intrinsic frequency ωIr is close to the smaller thermospheric buoyancy frequency N = N0. Here, and 0 are the asymptotic temperatures in the thermosphere and lower atmosphere, respectively, and N0 is the buoyancy frequency in the lower atmosphere. In the presence of dissipation, λz also increases in the thermosphere by a factor of ∼2--3 when ωIr > 0.2N0 and λz > 25 km during active solar conditions. GW dissipation altitudes and maximum vertical wavelengths, which increase as increases, are displayed for small-scale and midscale GWs. GWs excited from deep convection encounter horizontal shears, which impose anisotropy on the spectrum. Along with dissipative filtering, momentum flux divergence and body forces result. The thermospheric body forces resulting from our convection model achieve maximum accelerations at z 180--200 km, extend down to z 130 km, last for the duration of deep convection, are ∼600 km × 600 km × 40--80 km in the x, y, and z directions, and are very strong with accelerations ≃0.5--0.75 m s−2 and ≃0.25--0.4 m s−2 during extreme solar minimum ( = 600 K) and active solar conditions ( = 2000 K), respectively. During extreme solar minimum, there is negligible forcing above z ≃ 230 km, whereas the forcing extends up to z ≃ 360 km during active solar conditions. These horizontal, thermospheric body forces may be a new source of large-scale, long-period secondary GWs and induced TIDs (traveling ionospheric disturbances) at high altitudes in the thermposphere.},

   abstract = {Contour maps of mid-latitude geomagnetic perturbations of both north-south and east-west field components have been created to study the variability of magnetospheric substorm development. The maps were obtained by subtracting quiet day variations from observations along a longitudinal chain of observatories; this procedure created smooth interpolations of the resulting local time profiles at equal increments of universal time. The results were then contoured in the local time-universal time plane. To isolate magnetic perturbations during substorm expansions, `normalized'maps were created by first subtracting the local time profile at the onset of the expansion from all later profiles. Examples of substorm variability have been chosen to demonstrate multiple onsets and movement of bay activity either eastward or westward from the meridian of initial onset. The local time profile obtained from the normalized map at the peak of the expansion represents the mid-latitude effects of the final substorm current systems. These profiles match the magnetic effects of a simple model in which a portion of the tail current is diverted through the auroral ionosphere via field lines. These profiles are further used to compute substorm parameters that include the meridian of onset, the meridian of maximum bay development, the magnitude, and extent of the event. Such quantification allows for better description of substorm features than has previously been available.},

It uses the number of sunspot groups observed, rather than groups and individual sunspots. Daily, monthly, and yearly means are derived from 1610 to the present. The Group Sunspot Numbers use 65941 observations from 117 observers active before 1874 that were not used by Wolf in constructing his time series. Hence, we have calculated daily values of solar activity on 111358 days for 1610--1995, compared to 66168 days for the Wolf Sunspot Numbers. The Group Sunspot Numbers also have estimates of their random and systematic errors tabulated. The generation and preliminary analysis of the Group Sunspot Numbers allow us to make several conclusions: (1) Solar activity before 1882 is lower than generally assumed and consequently solar activity in the last few decades is higher than it has been for several centuries. (2) There was a solar activity peak in 1801 and not 1805 so there is no long anomalous cycle of 17 years as reported in the Wolf Sunspot Numbers. The longest cycle now lasts no more than 15 years. (3) The Wolf Sunspot Numbers have many inhomogeneities in them arising from observer noise and this noise affects the daily, monthly, and yearly means. The Group Sunspot Numbers also have observer noise, but it is considerably less than the noise in the Wolf Sunspot Numbers. The Group Sunspot Number is designed to be similar to the Wolf Sunspot Number, but, even if both indices had perfect inputs, some differences are expected, primarily in the daily values.},

@article{Lindzen1981,
   abstract = {It has been suggested (Lindzen, 1967, 1968a, b; Lindzen and Blake, 1971; Hodges, 1969) that turbulence in the upper mesosphere arises from the unstable breakdown of tides and gravity waves. Crudely speaking, it was expected that sufficient turbulence would be generated to prevent the growth of wave amplitude with height (roughly as (basic pressure)−1/2). This work has been extended to allow for the generation of turbulence by smaller amplitude waves, the effects of mean winds on the waves, and the effects of the waves on the mean momentum budget. The effects of mean winds, while of relatively small importance for tides, are crucial for internal gravity waves originating in the troposphere. Winds in the troposphere and stratosphere sharply limit the phase speeds of waves capable of reaching the upper mesosphere. In addition, the existence of critical levels in the mesosphere significantly limits the ability of gravity waves to generate turbulence, while the breakdown of gravity waves contributes to the development of critical levels. The results of the present study suggest that at middle latitudes in winter, eddy coefficients may peak at relatively low altitudes (50 km) and at higher altitudes in summer and during sudden warmings (70--80 km), and decrease with height rather sharply above these levels. Rocket observations are used to estimate momentum deposition by gravity waves. Accelerations of about 100 m/s/day are suggested. Such accelerations are entirely capable of producing the warm winter and cold summer mesopauses.},

A statistical study including a total of 138 Pc1--2 wave ducting events in 2007 presents wave power attenuation factors that vary between ∼10 and 14 dB/1000 km and the change of polarization during the wave propagation under different ionospheric sunlight conditions. It is also shown that the frequency cutoff of the wave events in the waveguide is dependent on the ionospheric conductivity, and the wave power attenuation increases with increasing frequency. In addition, it appears that initial propagation direction is related to attenuation, which supports the idea that meridional propagation is most efficient as predicted in previous studies. The results show the observations of ducted waves over such an unprecedented latitudinal extent along a magnetic meridian, which have rarely been measured before, and thus provide very important information in regard to wave ducting under various ionospheric conditions.},

These are the first numerical simulations to use the fundamental, physics-based equations in a full flux tube model for the self-consistent generation of MSTIDs. We show that a random perturbation results in the development of modes consistent with the Perkins instability and that the growth rate of a specified k perturbation agrees well with linear theory. We also present synthetic observations of MSTIDs: total electron content, integrated 630.0 nm airglow emission, E × B drift, and electron density. The modeling results show the signature of the instability in the geomagnetic conjugate hemisphere, which has been previously observed experimentally. The qualitative descriptions of the E × B drift and electron density profiles of the MSTIDs provided by SAMI3 are found to be consistent with experimental studies of MSTIDs found in the literature.},

@article{Zhou2005,
   abstract = {A pseudo-spectral method code is developed to simulate the electrodynamic instability (spread-F) behavior of the mid-latitude ionosphere by numerically solving two of the Perkins (J. Geophys. Res. 78 (1973) 218) equations. This work follows that of Miller (On gravity waves and the electrodynamics of the mid-latitude ionosphere, Ph.D. Thesis, Cornell University, 1996) and provides extensions in both the solution method---resulting in more precise, efficient and robust solutions---and in the range of solutions investigated. In the linear instability-development stage, the simulation result is consistent with the Perkins (1973) predictions, yielding relative differences of less than 0.6%. A random initial condition case like that of Miller (1996) is carried out with the result agreeing with Miller's result obtained in a different manner. In addition, the effect of non-linearity of the equation system is observed. The range of initial conditions investigated indicates that over a large wavelength range, self-similar ionospheric instability structures (Geophys. Res. Lett. 28 (2001) 4167) can be generated in conductivity and potential (the field-line integrated electron concentration is constant). Further, by using dual-wave-mode excitation with suitable parameters, saturation of the instability process is observed. Some dual-mode excitation processes are very different from the single-mode excitation case in many respects---especially in wavelength dependence. The turbulent saturation is observed in simulation to be caused by the E×B instability that requires a sharp conductivity gradient at the backside of the drift movement. On the other hand, other dual-mode excitation processes do not display a saturation state. In this case, the process converges to and then follows the path of the corresponding single-mode excitation example.},

Our observations show two separable superimposed signatures: (1) a gradual rise and fall in signal levels visible on almost all paths as the eclipse advances and then declines, as VLF attenuation is reduced by the changing ionosphere under an eclipsed Sun, and (2) direct reflective scattering off the narrow 100-km-wide totality spot, observed more uniquely when the transmitter or receiver, if not both, are relatively close to the totality spot.},

Using a basic model, we examine how subsidiary current flows are created by auroral ionospheric conductivity enhancements in the electrojet regions. These current flows, which include field-aligned currents, are associated with reflected shear AlfvÈn waves localized to the field lines which thread ionospheric conductivity gradients. Thus the ionosphere can create distinct latitudinal structure in the signal. We discuss the origin of the observed polarization pattern and predominantly westward phase propagation of Pi 2 pulsations in the light of our results. We conclude that a superposition of two travelling waves of differing amplitude is required to produce these characteristics.},

  abstract = {The strength and orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) has a strong effect on the high-latitude plasma convection pattern, thereby influencing the speed and direction of polar thermospheric winds. The possibility of similar IMF control over the compositional response of the thermosphere during geomagnetic disturbances has not been fully investigated. This study finds that the y-component of the IMF (IMF By) exerts significant control over the development and subsequent equatorward transport of composition disturbances during periods of heightened geomagnetic activity. This is determined using the NCAR-TIMEGCM to simulate the thermospheric conditions during the first 3 weeks far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging operations of the Dynamics Explorer 1 (DE-1) mission in 1981. The images reveal changes in the relative thermospheric column abundance of O versus N2 (ΣO/N2). These changes are reproduced by the model, incorporating variable IMF strength and orientation as inputs. It is found that simple reversal of IMF By leads to subsequent changes in ΣO/N2 at middle latitudes by as much as 30%. This is a manifestation of the effect identified in the companion to this report (Crowley et al., 2006). The study confirms the hypothesis of Immel et al. (1997) that IMF-By effects on middle-latitude thermospheric composition are important, though more complex than expected. Contrary to previous predictions, early morning local times are shown to be more likely to suffer large decreases in ΣO/N2 when By is negative. However, the overall magnitude of high-latitude Joule heating is found to be greater when By is positive.},

@article{Shiokawa1998,

The timing of this onset is compared with that of the substorm current wedge and Pi 2 magnetic pulsations observed by a large number of ground-based stations and the AMPTE/CCE, GOES 5, and ISEE 1 satellites and with that of high-energy particle injection observed at Los Alamos geosynchronous satellite 1982-019. The onset of earthward high-speed flow is observed 3 min before the onset of the global current wedge formation and 6 min before the onset of high-energy particle injection. The three bursts of the high-speed flow observed at AMPTE/IRM are likely to correspond to three compressional pulses observed at AMPTE/CCE at 6 RE and three Pi 2 wave packets observed at midlatitude ground stations. On the basis of these observations we conclude that the substorm current wedge is caused by inertia current and the current due to flow shear at the braking point of the earthward high-speed flow during the initial stage of the substorm expansion phase. The braking point is well separated from the near-Earth neutral line. It is also suggested that the compressional pulses and fluctuations of field-aligned currents generated at the flow braking point can be the initial cause of the Pi 2 magnetic pulsations in the inner magnetosphere.},

TEC oscillations with a period of ~4 min were also observed to the south of Moore for more than 8 h. A comparison between the TEC observations and infrared cloud image from the GOES satellite indicates that the concentric waves and short-period oscillations are caused by supercell-induced atmospheric gravity waves and acoustic resonances, respectively. This observational result provides the first clear evidence of a severe meteorological event causing atmospheric waves propagating upward in the upper atmosphere and reaching the ionosphere.},

That is, the average pulsation amplitude in the Pi 2 band as well as the amplitudes of pulsations at specific frequencies in the band have maximum amplitudes at latitudes close to the instantaneous electrojet location. Stations equatorward of the electrojet tend to observe a classical Pi 2 waveform concurrent with the onset of the substorm electrojet. Stations near the electrojet observe a broad spectrum of pulsations indicating a multiplicity of sources. Stations poleward of the initial electrojet position see little pulsation activity until the electrojet moves overhead. The appearance of large amplitude Pi 2 pulsations at a station which was poleward of the electrojet at the onset of a substorm appears to be coincident with the arrival of the poleward border of the electrojet.},

  abstract = {Scale dependence of nighttime medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) is studied with the midlatitude ionosphere electrodynamics coupling model by changing initial perturbation scales. It is shown that both sporadic E (Es) layer and Perkins instabilities have the scale dependence that a shorter wavelength mode tends to stop growing within a shorter period, whereas a very long wavelength mode grows so slowly in the E region that it does not effectively seed the Perkins instability in the F region. As a result, the typical wavelength of MSTIDs (100--200 km) can be spontaneously generated without scale-dependent forcing. It is also shown that long frontal structures of MSTIDs can be formed by the Pedersen polarization process along the wavefront of MSTIDs by which the wavefront is forced to be uniformly distributed.},

  abstract = {Reconstruction of the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment and Airborne Arctic Stratosphere Expedition aircraft constituent observations, radiative heating rate computations, and trajectory calculations are used to generate comparative pictures of the 1987 southern hemisphere (SH) late winter and 1989 northern hemisphere (NH) mid-winter, lower stratospheric, polar vortices. Overall, both polar vortices define a region of highly isolated air, where the exchange of trace gases occurs principally at the vortex edge through erosional wave activity. Aircraft measurement showed that (1) between 50 and 100 mbar, horizontally stratified long-lived tracers such as N2O are displaced downward 2--3 km on the cyclonic (poleward) side of the jet with the meridional tracer gradient sharpest at the jet core. (2) Eddy mixing rates, computed using parcel ensemble statistics, are an order of magnitude or more lower on the cyclonic side of the jet compared to those on the anticyclonic side. (3) Poleward zonal mean meridional flow on the anticyclonic side of the jet terminates in a descent zone at the jet core. Despite the similarities between the SH and NH winter vortices, there are important differences. During the aircraft campaign periods, the SH vortex jet core was located roughly 8$\,^\{\circ\}$--10$\,^\{\circ\}$ equatorward of its NH counterpart after pole centering. As a result of the larger size of the SH vortex, the dynamical heating associated with the jet core descent zone is displaced further from the pole. The SH polar vortex can therefore approach radiative equilibrium temperatures over a comparatively larger area than the NH vortex. The subsequent widespread formation of polar stratospheric clouds within the much colder SH vortex core gives rise to the interhemispheric differences in the reconstructed H2O, NOy, ClO, and O3, species which are affected by polar stratospheric clouds.},

The radar data are complemented with observations from the DMSP F15, TIMED, and NOAA-18 spacecraft to confirm that a backscatter feature observed at the equatorward edge of the auroral oval is a manifestation of SAPS/SAID. During a several hour long period on August 6, 2005, the velocity data indicate that significant changes in the SAPS flow occurred on time scales of a few minutes. The Wallops HF radar observations demonstrate that the SAPS phenomenon is a source of small-scale irregularities extending over many hours of MLT and that the electric fields associated with SAID in particular are highly variable.},

Based on the data from UHF radar, GPS total electron content, and ionosonde measurements, we found that artificial AGW/TID can be generated in ionospheric modification experiments by sinusoidally modulating the power envelope of the transmitted O-mode HF heater waves. In this case, the modulation frequency needs to be set below the characteristic Brunt--Vaisala frequency at the relevant altitudes. We avoided potential contamination from naturally-occurring AGW/TID of auroral origin by conducting the experiments during geomagnetically quiet time period. We determine that these artificial AGW/TID propagate away from the edge of the heated region with a horizontal speed of approximately 160 m/s.},

Observations at 30--80km altitudes show that the variances of horizontal scales less than ∼100km are strongly correlated with upper tropospheric convection, surface topography and stratospheric jetstreams. MLS monthly averages during solstice periods suggest that the normalized variance amplitude grows exponentially with height in the stratosphere, and saturates in the mesosphere as expected from wave breaking and dissipation at these altitudes.},

  abstract = {During magnetically disturbed days, wind and temperature data obtained in the F-region from incoherent scatter, show strong oscillations of the ion temperature and velocity with period of some 2 hr. These oscillations can be interpreted as due to atmospheric gravity waves travelling Southwards. In this paper, the data are compared to auroral magnetograms. Temperature and velocity oscillations appear to follow magnetic events such as substorms, with a time delay of about one hour. Theoretical computations show that the intense heat deposited in the auroral E-region during a magnetic substorm, can generate atmospheric waves which propagate towards midlatitudes. The characteristics of the computed waves are in close agreement with the observed ones. Finally, the calorific energy deposited at midlatitude by dissipation of such waves is evaluated. The resulting thermospheric temperature increase is comparable to that predicted by Jacchia's model.},

   abstract = {In this coordinated ground and space study, we report multiprobe measurements from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS), LANL-97A, Polar, and ground observatories for a substorm that occurred on 23 March 2007. The THEMIS fleet and LANL-97A were located in the premidnight, near-Earth plasma sheet in the radial range from 6.6 to 13 RE, placing the spacecraft into different plasma environments which were subject to different activities. Simultaneous global Polar Ultraviolet Imager images of the aurora revealed a fine structure in the auroral bulge in the form of several time-delayed regions of brightening. We demonstrate a correspondence between this fine structure and the spatially separated plasma sheet activities (substorm injections with energies >100 keV) by showing that both executed periodic (100--150 s) one-to-one correlated modulations. Additionally, the different auroral brightening regions were modulated approximately out of phase to one another, as were the separated plasma sheet activities. The periodic plasma sheet and optical modulations were also one-to-one correlated with large-amplitude (δH ∼150 nT) ground Pi2 pulsations. In contrast to the most energetic ions (>100 keV), the lower-energetic plasma sheet ions executed separate oscillations during the development of the substorm, including the preintensification phase, and showed the following properties. (1) The oscillation periods were different at different spacecraft locations and had a tendency to increase during the evolution of the substorm. During the preintensification phase, multiple (possibly harmonic) spectral components existed. (2) The oscillations were coupled to westward moving perturbations of an energized plasma boundary. The boundary perturbations were likely conjugate to azimuthally spaced auroral forms (``beads'') observed by Polar-UVI during the preintensification phase and could play a role in the onset of the substorm intensification. (3) The oscillations of the lower-energetic ions were also one-to-one correlated with smaller-amplitude ground Pi2 pulsations (<15 nT). In conclusion, the combination of these observations allowed us to construct a 3-D picture of low-frequency, near-Earth plasma sheet phenomena associated with a substorm and their connection to aurora and the ground. It appeared that not only one substorm current wedge, but additional current structures existed which started at different times, pulsated out of phase, and mapped from different active regions into the ionosphere. The active space regions appeared to be coupled and transferring energy from one region to the other while pulsating. We propose that the wave-like structures in the plasma sheet, observed before and during the substorm/intensification phase, and their demonstrated properties support a wave phenomenon (such as a ballooning-type mode) for the onset and development of the substorm/intensification, rather than directly driven periodic bursty bulk flow activations.},

The boundary corresponds to the inner edge of the neutral sheet. The average jump of the magnetic field at the boundary, which is estimated from the observations by assuming a pressure balance, is 6.7 nT.

@article{Kim2010,
   abstract = {Pi2 pulsations observed in the inner magnetosphere have been explained as radially trapped fast mode waves in the plasmasphere (i.e., plasmaspheric resonance). This model suggests that these waves can be globally detected at all local times in the inner magnetosphere when azimuthal propagation is allowed. There are no reports of Pi2-associated fast mode waves on the dayside in the inner magnetosphere, however. In this case study we focus on a Pi2 pulsation that was observed by the low-latitude Bohyun station (L = 1.35) in the postmidnight sector (MLT = 3.1) at 1853 UT on 27 February 2008. During the Pi2 event, Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS)-E was near the dawnside inner magnetosphere (MLT = 5.1 and L = 2.6), and THEMIS-D was near the duskside inner magnetosphere (MLT = 17.8 and L = 3.1), which are transition regions between nightside and dayside. On the dawnside, THEMIS-E observed poloidal oscillations characterized by the azimuthal component of the electric field (\&\{\#\}948;Ey) and the radial (\&\{\#\}948;Bx) and compressional (\&\{\#\}948;Bz) components of the magnetic field. These components had high coherence (\{$>$\}0.8) with a low-latitude Pi2 pulsation at Bohyun. We confirmed that the poloidal oscillations are radially standing fast mode waves excited by plasmaspheric resonance. On the duskside, however, no poloidal oscillations in the Pi2 frequency band were detected at THEMIS-D, indicating that the plasmaspheric resonance may not establish itself globally. We suggest that there is strong longitudinal attenuation of fast mode waves near the duskside, which may be due to complicated duskside plasmapause structures. In addition, a well-defined, trapped fast mode oscillation would be expected as a two-dimensional mode structure near the meridian plane of a source region.},

  abstract = {The motion of Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs) was measured for 1 year from the eastern tip of Brazil, about 10$\,^\{\circ\}$ degrees south of the magnetic and geographic equators using spaced fixed frequency radio transmitters. The motion was very similar during all of the year. The daytime average direction was towards 150$\,^\{\circ\}$ azimuth (clockwise from north) and speed was typically in the range 150--300 m/s. The azimuth varied only slightly during the day being slightly more easterly during evening-morning hours. During winter months there were also some TIDs whose motion was northward. None of the known sources for MSTIDs fits well with MSTIDs having these velocity patterns. A possible unconfirmed source is the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).},

   abstract = {Observations of medium-scale acoustic gravity waves using the Goose Bay HF radar are presented. Data were examined for the period of November and December 1991, and days that showed evidence of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) were selected for analysis. TIDs were identified in the HF radar data by quasi-periodic enhancements of the power in the ground-scattered portion of the radar signal. Various parameters were determined from the data, including the wave frequency, the wavelength, the propagation direction, and the phase velocity. It was found that multiple wave packets from multiple directions are often present simultaneously. Source times and locations were identified from data from 2 days, December 5 and 6, 1991, and these were compared with data from the Greenland magnetometer chain. The source times and locations were found to correspond to sudden magnetometer deflections, indicating the correlation of gravity wave sources with the occurrence of ionospheric electrojet current surges. Finally, the source times and locations were examined in local time and magnetic latitude, and it was found that the sources were clustered in two locations: near the magnetospheric cusp; and near 1600 MLT at about 75∞magnetic latitude.},

   abstract = {A numerical model of Pi 2 disturbances in the magnetosphere is developed. The model of the magnetosphere is the same as one previously used for the study of Pc 5 pulsations. It is semicylindrical with field lines being semicircular arcs and longitude measured parallel to the axis. The model magnetosphere is excited by a source on the boundary which is limited both in time and in longitude. The disturbance is then a superposition of modes corresponding to all the azimuthal wave numbers excited by the source. The computations show that a global oscillation is excited and that there can be a significant signal on the dayside at low latitudes. The role of the plasmasphere in producing a low-latitude response is important. Because of the simplifications of the model the most important aspect of the calculations is the qualitative understanding that they supply. Nevertheless, quite good quantitative agreement with observation is obtained. The calculations support earlier suggestions about the response of the magnetosphere to the initiation of the substorm current wedge.},

   abstract = {In recent years, all-sky camera airglow observations of evolving nighttime F-region structures have raised questions regarding the formation and apparent motion of these often wave-like structures. We address these issues using a pseudo-spectral method code developed to numerically solve the Perkins (1973. Spread F and ionospheric currents. J. Geophys. Res. 78, 218--226) moment equations modeling F-region electrodynamics. To aid in interpretation of the results, we utilize a Gaussian shape initial condition of the (geomagnetic field, B, parallel) integrated conductivity under the homogeneous TEC (B-parallel total electron content) condition and a northeastward DC electric field (E-field). We find that the initial Gaussian shape conductivity structure gradually evolves into banded structures oriented along the northwest--southeast direction while the amplitude of the banded structures continues growing and the peak of the structure moves to the northwest due to the E×B drift. The potential distribution corresponding to the initial Gaussian conductivity distribution is more complex but also becomes banded with the same orientation and growing trend as the conductivity. Wave vector domain plots show structure growth in approximately the first and third quadrants and damping in the second and fourth quadrants for both the conductivity and potential, as Perkins predicts---this leads to the orientation of the structures. We note that the evolved banded structures in conductivity and potential are oriented perpendicular to the direction given by half the angle between the DC E-field and east---the direction of maximum instability growth rate predicted by Perkins. The polarization (perturbation) E-field is seen mainly perpendicular to the long axis of the banded structures---i.e., no obvious structure-parallel E-field is observed in the simulation. By tracking the maximum point of the conductivity as a function of time, it is found that the localized structures move northwestward at a nearly constant speed that corresponds to the E×B drift velocity (to within relative errors on the direction and magnitude of ≃4%). We also note that the E×B drift velocity has a dominant effect on the speed and propagation direction of the wave-like bands. The ``wave''velocity is the projection of the E×B drift velocity on the line perpendicular to the wave front. Thus, the movement of a northwest--southeast oriented band can be decomposed into two components---parallel (to the band, northwestward) and perpendicular (southwestward) motions. A preliminary comparison of these results with an Arecibo all-sky camera observations shows good agreement.},

  abstract = {The High-Resolution Doppler Imager on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite has observed the O2 atmospheric band nightglow at extremely high spatial resolution of 50 km in the horizontal over much of Earth's surface. These observations of the oxygen nightglow are shown to be a good surrogate for atomic oxygen outflow from the thermosphere and subsequent recombination in the upper mesosphere. The distribution of enhanced airglow and recombination verify the previous observations that bright regions of the nightglow are associated with descending motion, where the tides are transporting atomic oxygen out of the thermosphere, and regions of decreased airglow are associated with ascending tidal motion. The detailed observations of the global airglow at a scale of 100 km present a much more complex picture, however. The tidally enhanced regions are extremely structured, with strong longitudinal and latitudinal variability in brightness and associated atomic oxygen recombination. These structured regions are persistent on a timescale of a day or more, with certain regions of the globe exhibiting enhanced airglow much of the time. These regions are present over the entire night side of the globe but are strongly modulated by the ascending and descending tidal motions. A theoretical study of these enhancements suggests that they are caused by the upward propagation of gravity waves, which break in the high mesosphere and induce strong vertical motion in the atmosphere. It is interesting that the primary cause of the increased transport of atomic oxygen is vertical motion rather than the conventional enhanced turbulence explanation. These gravity waves are associated with wind shear and strong convective activity in the troposphere and often appear in certain preferred locations where convective activity is expected. These observations have important implications for the basic processes by which momentum and energy are deposited in the upper mesosphere. We suggest that the processes must be modeled as stochastic events that dance around the base of the thermosphere, generally in climatologically preferred regions, rather than the relatively uniform distribution of gravity wave forcings that is being used in general circulation models up to this time.},

The detection of MEFs at higher altitudes than 1000 km by the Freja satellite confirms that the MEFs are transmitted along the geomagnetic field line without any significant damping. On one night of such conjugate observations, MEFs were observed in a traveling ionospheric disturbance (TID). On the other nights when the MEFs were observed by Freja, large scale density structures in the ionosphere were observed with the MU radar. Spread-F phenomena were also observed by ionosondes associated with these structures. The large scale modulation of the ionosphere, such as TIDs, might cause small scale modulations which grow through ionospheric instabilities. The linear growth rate is evaluated using a set of equations describing the growth of the mid-latitude ionospheric irregularities. The growth rate is shown to be too small under average conditions; however, when the neutral wind in TIDs is included, it is large enough to generate MEFs.},

@article{Richmond1978,
   abstract = {This is the first in a series of papers examining large-scale gravity waves in the thermosphere and their ability to transfer energy from high to low latitudes during magnetic disturbances. The gravity wave source is assumed to be either the Lorentz force of auroral electrojet currents or else a heat input due to energetic particle precipitation or to Joule heating. It is pointed out that the characteristic vertical width of the gravity wave source should usually lie between 2 and 4 pressure scale heights, placing constraints on the vertical wavelengths and horizontal velocities of the generated waves. A simplified analytic model of small-amplitude wave generation by a current source shows how wave energy production depends on the temporal and spatial dimensions of the source, on the electric field strength, and on the electron density enhancement. The steep thermospheric temperature gradient in the vicinity of the source altitude strongly influences the properties of upward and downward propagating waves compared with waves generated in an isothermal atmosphere. Waves produced by the Lorentz force of Hall currents, by the Lorentz force of Pedersen currents, and by Joule heating are influenced quite differently by this temperature gradient. Because upgoing waves above the source are combinations of waves originally launched upward and waves originally launched downward but reflected around 110 km altitude, the mean effective source altitude is about 110 km for the far field response in the thermosphere. Large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances observable at middle latitudes are most likely produced primarily by Pedersen, rather than Hall, currents. The temperature structure of the thermosphere generally causes gravity wave packets to refract upward; waves traveling with a horizontal component of velocity faster than 250 m/s and with an initial downward component of group velocity will always be reflected upward in the lower thermosphere. The effects of viscosity, heat conduction, and Joule dissipation tend to filter out shorter-period and slower moving waves from observation points at some distance from the source, so that only long-period fast moving waves can reach low latitudes from an auroral source. For example, a wave with a 94-min period moving horizontally at 605 m/s is largely dissipated by the time it has traveled 4000 km from a typical auroral source. A numerical simulation using a fairly realistic thermospheric model illustrates many of the points described from analytic considerations.},

Those small- and medium-scale GWs which reach the thermosphere dissipate at z ∼120--250 km in a direction opposite to the background wind ∼(1--2) density scale heights below. This localized momentum deposition creates horizontal thermospheric body forces that have large sizes and amplitudes and generates large-scale secondary GWs and large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (LSTIDs) that propagate globally away from the body force in all directions except that perpendicular to the force direction. For the convective plume at 2120 UT, the secondary GWs have horizontal wavelengths of λH ∼2100--2200 km, periods of τr ∼80 min, horizontal phase speeds of cH ∼480--510 m/s, density perturbations as large as ∣ρ′/∣∼3.6--5% at z = 400 km, relative \{$[$\}O\{$]$\} perturbations as large as ∼2--2.5% at z = 300 km, and total electron content perturbations as large as ∼8%. This transfer of momentum from local, relatively slow, small scales at the tropopause to global, fast, large scales in the thermosphere is independent of geomagnetic conditions. The various characteristics of these large-scale waves may explain observations of LSTIDs at magnetically quiet times. We also find that this body force creates a localized ``mean''horizontal wind in the direction of the body force. For the plume at 2120 UT, the wind is southward with an estimated maximum of vmax ∼−400 m s−1 that is dissipated after ∼4 h. We also find that the induced body force direction varies throughout the day, depending on the winds in the lower thermosphere.},

This is done by combining intensity-calibrated optical data at 557.7 nm from the Digital All-Sky Imager (DASI) with auroral absorption images from the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS). Energy maps are produced with high temporal (10 s) and spatial (10 km) resolution within a common geographic area of 240 ◊240 km. Both IRIS and DASI have the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar within their common field of view. EISCAT is capable of making accurate measurements of the electron density height profile which, with the assistance of an atmospheric model, are inverted into equivalent energy spectra of the flux of precipitating electrons. However, incoherent scatter radars generally have a very small field of view (\{$<$\}1∞), making studies of the energy spectrum of the precipitating particles over a wide field of view impractical. Since IRIS and DASI are sensitive to high- and medium-energy electrons, respectively, EISCAT data are used to calibrate the characteristic energy of the precipitating particles for an assumed energy spectrum against a combination of IRIS and DASI data. This empirical calibration is then used throughout the common field of view of IRIS and DASI. An initial study illustrates the spatial relationship between the different energy ranges during a substorm onset and illustrates a new way to interpret auroral phenomena.},

   abstract = {The transfer function approach in terms of vector spherical harmonics is used to describe the thermospheric response to time dependent sources on the globe. The computations are carried out for frequencies from 0 to 140 cycles per day (c/d), corresponding to periods of almost 10 min; the horizontal wavelength resolution is about 200 km. In the transfer function, we can distinguish basically two kinds of waves, trapped and propagating ones. The trapped waves have the character of a low pass filter, i.e., the large scale and long term variations are preferentially excited. The propagating waves comprise the fundamental, quasi-horizontally propagating wave and the reflected and ducted wave modes. These waves become important at frequencies above 3 c/d. Using the Fourier integral representation, impulsive perturbations are simulated for source distributions on the globe. The following features characterize the thermospheric response: (1) The dynamic processes are most important during the energization phase. Winds then redistribute energy and mass globally. (2) The temperature and density perturbations remain for some time after the source has been turned off, heat conduction and diffusion accounting primarily for the slow decay. With decreasing source altitude the relaxation time-constant increases. (3) Propagating gravity waves are launched mainly when the source is abruptly turned on or off. The source frequency spectrum is then very broad and the waves are generated by ringing. Near the source, their pulse durations are typically on the order of 20 min and are determined, through the dispersion relation for gravity waves, by the horizontal dimension of the source (about 700 km). As the waves propagate away from the source, the longer periods (and wave lengths) become more important, consistent with classical gravity wave theory. (4) After the source is turned off, the atmospheric circulation reverses, exhibiting a global scale oscillation which is determined by the duration of the disturbance. (5) Outside the source region, the onset of the disturbance is delayed corresponding to horizontal signal velocities of about 800 m/s, near the local speed of sound. Due to reflection from the base of the thermosphere, a second signal is launched which propagates with a velocity of about 380 m/s. This wave, however, is rapidly attenuated. A weaker third signal is launched which propagates with a velocity of only 230 m/s and therefore dominates the response near the source region (high latitudes) some time after the onset of the disturbance. This is the ducted wave from the lower atmosphere, which is weakly attenuated and can travel large distances away from the source. (6) The time delays between the maxima in the temperature and densities are controlled by the time constants for heat conduction and diffusion (which can be relatively long), but are limited by the duration of the disturbance.},

These equations have been numerically coded into a global ray-tracing model that the authors have applied to the three-dimensional CIRA 1986 reference atmosphere model in a series of preliminary experiments to investigate the impact of the newly incorporated features on synthesized wave fields in the middle atmosphere. Three main points emerge from these experiments. First, there is a striking reduction in the high-frequency cutoff with decreasing horizontal wavenumber due to a more complete dispersion relation. Second, adoption of a climatological, height-varying turbulent diffusivity profile based on measurements indicates that turbulent damping is more important than scale-dependent infrared radiative damping over a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies in all but the lower levels of the middle atmosphere. Last, the authors demonstrate that the presence of climatological planetary waves during the northern winter produces greatly varied ray paths for waves of fixed characteristics launched from different longitudes. The implications of these findings for future ray-tracing studies are discussed.},

Observations from the geomagnetic storm on 26--27 September 2011 are presented for two distinct SED events. During an hour-long period of geomagnetic activity driven by a coronal mass ejection, a channel of high-density F region plasma was transported from the dayside subauroral ionosphere and into the polar cap by enhanced convection electric fields extending to middle latitudes. This TOI feature was associated with enhanced HF backscatter, indicating that it was the seat of active formation of small-scale irregularities. After the solar wind interplanetary magnetic field conditions quieted and the dayside convection electric fields retreated to higher latitudes, an SED plume was observed extending to, but not entering, the dayside cusp region. This prominent feature in the distribution of total electron content (TEC) persisted for several hours and elongated in magnetic local time with the rotation of the Earth. No ionospheric scatter from SuperDARN radars was observed within this SED region. The source mechanism (enhanced electric fields) previously drawing the plasma from midlatitudes and into the polar cap as a TOI was no longer active, resulting in a fossil feature. We thus demonstrate the controlling role exercised by the convection electric field in generating a TOI from midlatitude SED.},

The ray model was used to trace gravity waves through realistic three-dimensional daily-varying background atmospheres in the region, based on forecasts and analyses in the troposphere and stratosphere and climatologies higher up. Reverse ray tracing based on upper stratospheric lidar observations at Sondrestrom was also used to try to objectively identify wave source regions in the troposphere. A source spectrum specified by reverse ray tracing experiments in early August 1996 (when atmospheric flow patterns produced enhanced transmission of waves into the upper stratosphere) yielded model results throughout the remainder of August 1996 that agreed best with the lidar observations. The model also simulated increased vertical group propagation of waves between 40 km and 80 km due to intensifying mean easterlies, which allowed many of the gravity waves observed at 40 km over Sondrestrom to propagate quasi-vertically from 40--80 km and then interact with any mesospheric clouds at 80 km near Sondrestrom, supporting earlier experimentally-inferred correlations between upper stratospheric gravity wave activity and mesospheric cloud backscatter from Sondrestrom lidar observations. A pilot experiment of real-time runs with the model in 2001 using weather forecast data as a low-level background produced less agreement with lidar observations. We believe this is due to limitations in our specified tropospheric source spectrum, the use of climatological winds and temperatures in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, and missing lidar data from important time periods.},

The THEMIS C, D, and E satellites were outbound in a ``string-of-pearls'' configuration and each observed EMIC waves on L-shells ranging from 5 to 6.5. THEMIS resolved some of the spatial-temporal ambiguity and defined the radial extent of EMIC activity to be ∼1.3 Re. The band-limited EMIC waves were seen slightly further out in radial distance by each subsequent THEMIS satellite, but in each case were bounded at high-L by a decrease in density as monitored by spacecraft potential. The EMIC wave activity appears to be confined to a region of higher plasma density in the vicinity of the plasmapause, as verified by ground-based cross-phase analysis. The structured EMIC waves seen at THEMIS E and on the ground have the same repetition period, in contradiction to expectations from the bouncing wave packet hypothesis. Compression-related EMIC waves are usually thought to be preferentially confined to higher L's than observed here. Our observations suggest solar wind density enhancements may also play a role in the excitation of radially localised EMIC waves near the plasmapause.},

   abstract = {Observations of midlatitude spread F irregularities have shown that the most violent eruptions are often periodic and may be related to modulations of the F region bottomside. Similar aspects of equatorial spread F have been conclusively shown to be the result of seeding by atmospheric gravity waves. In this paper, we pursue a nonlinear description of the midlatitude F region instability first proposed by Perkins (1973) and show that, by itself, this instability saturates at approximately 1%. With gravity wave seeding, however, the growth of the instability is significantly enhanced and progresses until it is limited by third- or fourth-order nonlinearities. In the course of the analysis we expand the Perkins linear instability study, particularly with regard to the wave propagation angles suitable for stimulating linearly unstable, and eventually, nonlinear turbulent upwellings. Although gravity waves themselves have limited spatial extent, we also show that gravity waves which propagate perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field create electric fields which map along the field lines to considerable distances. This transmission of electric fields is dependent on both the particular characteristics of the ionosphere along the field lines and the wavelength of the perturbation, but under certain circumstances, gravity wave-induced large-scale electric fields can map to the F region from either the E or conjugate F region and thus influence F region electrodynamics. Finally, we note that our results are consistent with observations of midlatitude spread F irregularities by the MU radar in Japan and large-scale perturbations of the F region over Arecibo.},

   abstract = {Studying magnetically conjugate phenomena at very high latitudes requires a magnetic coordinate system that is smooth and well defined at the geographic poles. In addition, it should provide for accurate comparisons at different altitudes. In this report we present a variation on the corrected geomagnetic coordinate system that is well defined and smooth over the entire globe. It provides an analytic expression relating geographic coordinates, including altitude, to the magnetic coordinates. The coordinate system is produced by tracing magnetic field lines using the IGRF85 reference magnetic field model with time derivatives updating the model to 1988. An expansion of the relationship in terms of spherical harmonics has been determined, which then provides the required well-defined and smooth relationship over the entire globe. Independent expansions for different altitudes show a smooth functional relationship of the coefficients of the expansion with altitude, and therefore simple interpolation schemes can be used to provide an appropriate expansion at any altitude between 0 km and approximately 600 km. By reversing the process, the inverse expansions relating the magnetic coordinates to geographic coordinates have also been determined. The effects of the seasonal variation in the Sun\&\{\#\}8217;s declination along with the variation in the Sun\&\{\#\}8217;s apparent position due to the eccentricity of the Earth\&\{\#\}8217;s orbit result in a variation of nearly 1 hour of magnetic local time for a fixed UT over the course of a year. In many applications this variation may be important and should be included when presenting data in terms of magnetic latitude and MLT.},

The variations are deduced from electron density profiles measured by the incoherent radar in which the radar beam is offset 17$\,^\{\circ\}$ in zenith and rotated continuously in azimuth. This scanning procedure shows that the ionosphere above Arecibo often has well-defined bands where the F region as a whole is alternately high and low. The transition between adjoining regions is very sharp. For example, electron density profiles taken at points only a few degrees apart in azimuth, which corresponds to a spatial separation of less than 10 km, can show variations in hmax of up to 70 km. It is suggested that these bands are manifestations of the so-called `Perkins' instability.},

Using 6 years (2000\&\{\#\}8211;2005 inclusive) of vorticity measurements made by six SuperDARN radars in the Northern Hemisphere, we have compiled, for the first time, maps of average vorticity across the northern polar ionosphere. These maps have been subdivided according to different seasonal and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The variations in the morphology of the vorticity maps with IMF direction match very closely those seen in maps of average FAC intensity (determined using different methods and instrumentation), suggesting that vorticity is a good proxy for FAC in an averaged sense. The variations in the morphology of the vorticity maps with season show differences from those seen in the FAC maps, illustrating that ionospheric conductance plays a major role in determining the differences between measurements of vorticity and FAC.},

The analysis is based on a 9 year record (2003 to 2011) of radiance measurements by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. We detect gravity waves based on 4.3 µm brightness temperature variances. Our method focuses on peak events, i.e., strong gravity wave events for which the local variance considerably exceeds background levels. We estimate the occurrence frequencies of these peak events for different seasons and time of day and use the results to find local maxima or ``hotspots.'' In addition, we use AIRS radiances at 8.1 µm to simultaneously detect convective events, including deep convection in the tropics and mesoscale convective systems at middle latitudes. We classify the gravity wave sources based on seasonal occurrence frequencies for convection, but also by means of time series analyses and topographic data. Our study reproduces well-known hotspots of gravity waves, e.g., the Andes and the Antarctic Peninsula. However, the high horizontal resolution of the AIRS observations also allows us to locate numerous mesoscale hotspots, which are partly unknown or poorly studied so far. Most of these mesoscale hotspots are found near orographic features like mountain ranges, coasts, lakes, deserts, or isolated islands. This study will help to select promising regions and seasons for future case studies of gravity waves.},

For plasma convecting across a stationary disturbance a dynamic equilibrium is achieved in which field-aligned currents flow continuously away from the source on convecting field lines.

   abstract = {The dynamics of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling has been investigated by means of a two-dimensional two\&\{\#\}8212;fluid MHD model including anomalous resistivity. When field-aligned current is generated on auroral field lines, the disturbance propagates toward the ionosphere in the form of a kinetic AlfvÈn wave. When the current exceeds a critical value, microscopic turbulence is produced, which modifies the propagation of the AlfvÈn wave. This process is modeled by a nonlinear collision frequency, which increases with the excess of the drift velocity over the critical value. The system evolves toward an electrostatic structure, with the perpendicular electric field having a shorter scale than the field-aligned current. The approach to a steady state is strongly dependent on the presence or absence of the turbulence and on the boundary conditions imposed in the generator. As current is increased or scale size is decreased, the turbulent region reflects and absorbs most of the AlfvÈn wave energy, decoupling the generator from the ionosphere.},

Ionospheric storms represent an extreme form of space weather with important effects on ground- and space-based technological systems. These phenomena are driven by highly variable solar and magnetospheric energy inputs to the Earth's upper atmosphere, which continue to provide a major difficulty for attempts now being made to simulate the detailed storm response of the coupled neutral and ionized upper atmospheric constituents using increasingly sophisticated global first principle physical models. Several major programs for coordinated theoretical and experimental study of these storms are now underway. These are beginning to bear fruit in the form of improved physical understanding and prediction of ionospheric storm effects at high, middle, and low latitude.},

   abstract = {The database of the nine radars of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) in the northern hemisphere has been analyzed for information on factors that influence the convection of plasma in the high-latitude ionosphere. The velocity measurements were collected over the period 1998\&\{\#\}8211;2002. The data were first used to derive a new statistical model of convection that improves upon the earlier one-radar model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996) in its specification of the dependence of the convection pattern on the magnitude and direction of the IMF in the GSM Y-Z plane. We then derived average patterns for secondary sortings by season, year, and radar. Such dependencies as emerged were most clearly seen by contrasting the results for B y + and B y &#8722;. The seasonal effect in the convection pattern is found to have similarities to that of the sign of B y . In particular, the combination of B y +/summer (B y &#8722;/winter) reinforces the tendency of the B y sign factor to sculpt the dusk and dawn cells into more round/crescent (crescent/round) shapes and to shift the crescent cell across the midnight MLT meridian. However, these combinations are associated with lower estimates of the total cross polar cap potential drop, &#934;PC, while the nonreinforcing combinations produce elevated &#934;PC, especially B y &#8722;/summer. There is an overall tendency for &#934;PC to increase from winter to summer, although the pure seasonal effect on the potential drop is weaker than that of the B y &#8722;sign/season factor. We did not find pronounced differences among the patterns derived for the 5 individual years, which spanned the most recent interval of solar cycle maximum. Sorting by radar, we found few differences among the patterns for B y +, but for B y &#8722;, variations emerged that are consistent with a possible dependence on universal time (UT). The impacts of season and UT on convection in the high-latitude ionosphere thus depends on the IMF, especially the sign of B y . We speculate that variability in the ionospheric conductivity has a greater effect on magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling under B y &#8722; conditions.},

   abstract = {An index, denoted by AE, is derived as a measure of global electrojet activity. The basic data used are 2.5-minute readings of the H trace in the standard magnetograms from seven auroral-zone observatories. The readings are referenced to a level determined for each observatory from quiet intervals. All the data from the seven observatories are then plotted against UT, and two envelopes are drawn to embrace all the points. The index AE at any epoch is defined by the distance (or separation) between the upper and lower envelopes at that epoch. When viewed as functions of UT the upper and lower envelopes themselves show development and decay of positive and negative variations. It is found that a positive excursion usually accompanies a negative (larger) variation, confirming the well known feature of polar disturbance. The AE index for a 6-day period, February 10\&\{\#\}8211;15, 1958, shows that polar disturbances statistically repeat with a time interval of about 4 hours, and that the average duration of their most active phase is a little more than 1 hour. It is pointed out that the average repetition time of 4 hours is comparable with that of the electron flux enhancements observed by Anderson et al. in the magnetosphere tail. It is suggested that polar disturbances are directly related to Anderson's \&\{\#\}8216;electron islands\&\{\#\}8217; in the magnetosphere tail.},

   abstract = {The total solar eclipse of March 9, 1997, was visible from some regions of China, Mongolia, and East Siberia during 0045--0130 UT. The eclipse coincided with a relatively long geomagnetically quiet period. During the total solar eclipse, the observations included oblique-incidence ionograms recording; also measurement the total electron content along specified directions to the visible Global Positioning System satellites and the Doppler sounding on various HF ray paths over the region under consideration were carried out. This paper presents results derived from studying the spatial pattern of midlatitude ionospheric response to this eclipse on the basis of a numerical simulations. Calculations have been executed using a model for ionosphere-plasmasphere coupling. Comparison of model results with data of all measurements showed a good qualitative and quantitative agreement. It is shown that by and large the behavior of the ionosphere during the eclipse manifests itself as a short-lasting (∼l-hour) rearrangement to nighttime conditions with the ion flow directed downward from the plasmasphere, as a rise of the F2 layer maximum by about 20 km, and as a twofold increase in electron density at the height of the maximum during the eclipse's totality phase. The electron temperature decreases by 200--400 K, while the ion temperature drops only slightly. It is found that changes in the spatial distribution of electron density along the HF ray paths during the eclipse give rise to variations of Doppler frequency shift with amplitudes of about 1 Hz and a duration of about 120 min. The findings reported in this paper do not validate the hypothesis that solar eclipses generate atmospheric gravity waves and associated traveling ionospheric disturbances.},

   note = {The theoretical and observational evidence concerning the global propagation of atmospheric gravity waves is reviewed, with special emphasis on waves generated in the auroral zones. Gravity-wave theory predicts that the response to an auroral source mechanism consists of a discrete spectrum of upper-atmospheric guided modes and a continuous spectrum of freely propagating internal waves. Ionospheric observations confirm the existence of this dichotomy by revealing two distinct classes of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs): large-scale TIDs associated with the guided modes and medium-scale TIDs associated with the freely propagating waves. TIDs of both classes have been observed to propagate for thousands of km without apparent attenuation. Large-scale TIDs observed at midlatitudes invariably travel toward the Equator, and their occurrence is strongly correlated with severe magnetic storms. Taken together, these facts imply that the only natural sources of large-scale TIDs are in the auroral zones. Theory supports this conjecture with the prediction that the guided modes associated with large-scale TIDs can be excited only by upper-atmospheric sources (in the E-region or above), since these modes consist of surface gravity waves ducted by the steep temperature gradients at the base of the thermosphere. Unlike these guided modes, the continuous spectrum of internal waves can be excited by sources at any altitude, so that their concomitant medium-scale TIDs are much more common than large-scale TIDs, and it is therefore difficult to identify their origins. Some observational evidence does exist, however, relating midlatitude medium-scale TIDs with auroral sources. In this connection, theoretical calculations predict that the average fluctuations of the auroral electrojet are sufficient to generate observable internal waves which propagate freely to large horizontal distances with no loss of amplitude, despite geometrical spreading, the Earth's curvature, and the absence of conventional ducting mechanisms. The effects of geometrical spreading are complicated by the anisotropic nature of gravity-wave propagation, with the result that even spherically spreading gravity waves observed at a fixed height can appear to grow as they travel away from their source. The Earth's curvature presents no barrier to long-distance propagation of such waves because they are refracted around the Earth by the gravitational field. The observed atmospheric response to nuclear explosions clearly illustrates these effects.},

Several substorm models, mostly phenomenological, are presently under consideration. These competing models, each being justifiable on the basis of certain features of a substorm, have major differences as well as similarities among them. A synthesis substorm model is desirable, as first suggested by Siscoe (1986). In this paper we construct a coherent description of substorm development by extracting some important components from these existing models. The scenario of the synthesis model includes the ionospheric influence on substorm expansion onset, current disruptions leading to convection surges and tailward propagating rarefaction waves, wave-induced precipitation, local time expansion of the disturbance region via velocity-shear-related instabilities, plasma sheet heating by resonant absorption of hydromagnetic waves, and the formation of magnetic reconnection domains. This synthesis represents one possible way to integrate the different existing models coherently.},

   abstract = {Continuous MF and meteor radar observations allow detailed studies of winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) as well as temperatures around the mesopause. This height region is characterized by a strong variability in winter due to enhanced planetary wave activity and related stratospheric warming events, which are distinct coupling processes between lower, middle and upper atmosphere. Here the variability of mesospheric winds and temperatures is discussed in relation with major and minor stratospheric warmings as observed during winter 2005/06 in comparison with results during winter 1998/99. Our studies are based on MF radar wind measurements at Andenes (69$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 16$\,^\{\circ\}$E), Poker Flat (65$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 147$\,^\{\circ\}$W) and Juliusruh (55$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 13$\,^\{\circ\}$E) as well as on meteor radar observations of winds and temperatures at Resolute Bay (75$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 95$\,^\{\circ\}$W), Andenes (69$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 16$\,^\{\circ\}$E) and Kühlungsborn (54$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 12$\,^\{\circ\}$E). Additionally, energy dissipation rates have been estimated from spectral width measurements using a 3 MHz Doppler radar near Andenes. Particular attention is directed to the changes of winds, turbulence and the gravity wave activity in the mesosphere in relation to the planetary wave activity in the stratosphere. Observations indicate an enhancement of planetary wave 1 activity in the mesosphere at high latitudes during major stratospheric warmings. Daily mean temperatures derived from meteor decay times indicate that strong warming events are connected with a cooling of the 90 km region by about 10--20 K. The onset of these cooling processes and the reversals of the mesospheric circulation to easterly winds occur some days before the changes of the zonal circulation in the stratosphere start indicating a downward propagation of the circulation disturbances from the MLT region to the stratosphere and troposphere during the stratospheric warming events. The short-term reversal of the mesospheric winds is followed by a period of strong westerly winds connected with enhanced turbulence rates and an increase of gravity wave activity in the altitude range 70--85 km.},

   abstract = {Following the database of large-scale vortices during pseudo-breakup and breakup registered by the Gillam All-Sky Imager, we selected one event (19 February 1996) for a detailed consideration. This event is a sequence of pseudo-breakup and local substorm, and breakup followed by the large substorm, which is isolated from the previous pseudo-breakup by the second growth phase. Commencement of these elements of auroral activity was clearly seen above the Churchill line of the Canadian Auroral Network for the OPEN Program Unified Study (CANOPUS; pseudo-breakup was completely covered by the field of view of the Gillam All-Sky Imager). Geotail was located at \&\{\#\}8764;19 RE in the equatorial plane of midnight sector, which, along with supporting observations from two geostationary satellites (GOES 8 and 9), allowed for a comparison of ground-based, geostationary orbit and midtail signatures. The pseudo-breakup consisted of two distinct stages: a near-exponential arc intensity growth and a poleward vortex expansion that started simultaneously with dipolarization in the inner magnetosphere. The latter corresponded to explosive onset of short-period (tens of millihertz) pulsations observed at geostationary orbit and on the ground in the vicinity of the arc. No significant disturbances poleward of the vortex were observed. Pseudo-breakup was followed by the second growth phase, which involved a significant thinning of the plasma sheet. Breakup was of a similar two-stage character as the pseudo-breakup. Full onset of the expansive phase that followed breakup was seen simultaneously by all instruments including Geotail, which detected strong perturbations in the midtail. The expansive phase onset launched the second postbreakup package of Pi2 pulsations that were of larger amplitude. Finally, during the substorm recovery phase, the poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs) were observed as long-period, on the order of 10 min, pulses of electron precipitation. PBI commencement coincided with bursty flows and pulses of plasma energization in the midtail. Observed features support recent ideas claiming that we are dealing with processes (breakup, full onset of the expansive phase, and PBIs) of a distinct physical nature that require different commencement thresholds, namely, the inner plasma sheet instability (pseudo-breakup and breakup), midtail reconnection (expansive phase onset), and further magnetotail dynamics during the recovery phase (PBIs).},

   abstract = {We use Canadian Auroral Network for the OPEN Program Unified Study All-Sky Imager (ASI) and Meridional Scanning Photometer (MSP) data as the basis for a study of the dynamics of large-scale (hundreds of kilometers) auroral vortices. We consider 28 events corresponding to a range of auroral activity levels. Three of these are presented in detail, one corresponding to growth phase, one to pseudo-breakup and one to expansive phase onset. We show that vortex formation starts from a discrete arc with half thickness \&\{\#\}948; of the order of 20 km. This arc intensifies near the poleward boundary of enhanced proton aurora, as seen in the Hydrogen \&\{\#\}946; (H\&\{\#\}946;) MSP data and becomes azimuthally structured. This structuring is in the form of vortices with wavelength of the order of \&\{\#\}8764; 2\&\{\#\}960;\&\{\#\}948;. The vortices intensify and extend radially, leading to broadening of the initial arc. While the sizes and growth rates of the vortices vary, the overall scenario of vortex evolution is similar for all of the events. Structures that develop during the growth phase saturate at latitudes matching the poleward boundary of H\&\{\#\}946; emissions and pseudo-breakup structures saturate further poleward. Expansive phase onset vortices expand poleward in a similar fashion, but we do not observe any saturation stage, presumably due to limitations imposed by the ASI field of view. We present results of shear flow ballooning vortex modeling in which we used initial conditions and parameters consistent with our observations. On the basis of our model results, we speculate that all of these experimentally observed vortices are the result of shear flow ballooning instability in the hot proton region in the near-Earth plasma sheet.},

We find that it is possible to distinguish a dispersionless electron injection by it's integrated (\{$>$\}30 keV) flux signature at in situ satellites with a simple rise time criteria. If the total electron flux \{$>$\}30 keV exhibits a dramatic rise within 3 minutes then the signature is guaranteed to correspond to a dispersionless injection. Since the Kennel-Petschek limit for strong pitch angle scattering is almost certainly met during substorm injections and riometers respond to the \{$>$\}30 keV energy range, this translates to an equivalent criteria for riometer absorption. We present results obtained using our selection criteria for the ground-based identification of dispersionless electron injections including MLT dependence and initial spatial extent of the electron injection region.},

   abstract = {A spectral model is presented to describe the acoustic-gravity wave response in a multiconstituent thermosphere on a spherical earth with realistic vertical temperature distribution. The waves are treated as perturbations in a globally uniform atmosphere without background winds. For periods much less than one day, the effects of planetary rotation (Coriolis force) are relatively small, and Legendre polynomials (zonal spherical harmonics) are then the appropriate eigenfunctions to describe the horizontal variations. Through numerical integration in height, the transfer function is constructed for some vertical source distribution in the thermosphere. In the horizontal wave number space (order of polynomials), the transfer-function reveals four components: (1) The trapped component which is confined to the source region. (2) The quasi-horizontally propagating wave which is represented by the lower cut-off and the first resonance maximum in the transfer function. In the thermosphere it is also the dominant maximum. The horizontal wave length and propagation velocity (about 700 m/s) are large. (3) The obliquely propagating waves, generated primarily through partial reflection from the base of the thermosphere or total reflection from the earth's surface. These waves appear as broad secondary maxima in the transfer function; their horizontal wave lengths and propagation velocities are relatively small; they are important near the source but cannot propagate very far horizontally. (4) The ducted waves which are produced in the lower atmosphere by total reflection from the earth's surface and partial reflection from the mesopause temperature minimum. Leaking back into the thermosphere where they originate, these waves have relatively short wavelengths but can travel large horizontal distances away from the source (pole to equator). The important first and second harmonic modes have propagation velocities of 250 and 170 m/s respectively and appear in the transfer function as narrow resonance maxima. Such waves may explain the medium scale travelling ionospheric disturbances at low latitudes which are associated with magnetic activity.},

  abstract = {Tsunoda and Cosgrove [2001] recently pointed out that the F layer and sporadic E (Es) layers in the nighttime midlatitude ionosphere must be considered electrodynamically as a coupled system in light of the presence of a Hall polarization process in Es layers [Haldoupis et al., 1996; Tsunoda, 1998; Cosgrove and Tsunoda, 2001, 2002a] and the fact that kilometer-scale electric fields map efficiently between the E and F regions. They further noted the apparent presence of positive feedback between processes in those regions. Cosgrove and Tsunoda [2002b, 2003] have since shown that Es layers are unstable with properties not unlike those of the Perkins instability in the F region [Perkins, 1973], motivating the idea that the two instabilities may couple. Finally, Cosgrove and Tsunoda [2004] derived the linear growth rate for the coupled system of a Es layer and the F layer, thus realizing a unified formalism for the Perkins and Es layer (EsL) instabilities. They found that the growth rate was significantly enhanced by the coupling. However, the growth rate computed in Cosgrove and Tsunoda [2004] was expressed only as the largest eigenvalue of a very complex 3 × 3 matrix. In this paper we present a physical interpretation of the E-F coupled-layer (EFCL) instability, and derive the condition for maximal coupling. We obtain a circuit model for the coupled-layer system that provides a physical interpretation for the wavelength dependence of electric field mapping between layers, and allows quantitative predictions. Using the circuit model we derive a ``rule of thumb'' for computing the two growth rates of the coupled system from the isolated Perkins and EsL instability growth rates. We compare the result with the exact computation of Cosgrove and Tsunoda [2004].},

The Pi2 pulsations were observed at five ground stations located between 2130 and 2330 magnetic local time (MLT) ranging from L=1.83 to 3.75, which showed nearly identical waveforms in the H component with a frequency of \&\{\#\}8764;20 mHz. Five additional ground stations located between L=4.48 and \&\{\#\}8764;15 (on similar meridians) recorded weaker less-correlated signals. The pulsations were also detected both simultaneously and with a time delay of \&\{\#\}8764;38 s at two low-latitude stations (L=1.17 and 1.23) on the dayside at \&\{\#\}8764;1030 and \&\{\#\}8764;0612 MLT, respectively, indicating the global extend of the pulsations. The nightside ground data showed an amplitude maximum and a phase reversal in the H component between L=3.4 and 3.75. During the oscillations the Polar satellite moved (on the same meridian as the ground stations in the nightside) from 14∞to 10∞magnetic latitude and from L=4.1 to 3.7. Electric and magnetic field measurements also showed two Pi2 pulsation events (\&\{\#\}8764;20 mHz) in both the compressional (B z and E y ) and transverse (B y and E x ) mode components with waveforms almost identical to the ground signals. Whereas the first Pi2 had a standing wave structure in the compressional mode, the second Pi2 was a propagating wave. Both Pi2s had standing wave signatures in the transverse mode. The amplitude of the compressional magnetic field component (B z ) was \&\{\#\}8764;40% of that of the azimuthal component (B y ). Although the two Pi2 events showed equal amplitudes in the H component of ground data, Polar recorded much larger oscillations in the azimuthal magnetic field component (B y ) of the first Pi2 event; the fast mode amplitude (B z ) was nearly unchanged for both Pi2s. This suggests that Polar was at or near a localized FLR excited by the oscillations of the fast mode waves. During the in situ FLR observation, Polar's footpoint was closest to the ground stations which recorded the amplitude maximum and the phase reversal in the H component.},

We demonstrate an event in which the initial brightening of an arc developed into a series of auroral spirals and finally into a westward-travelling surge. Two intervals of spiral formation were observed, but only the second of these generated a surge-like feature. Since the surge formation occurred on a time-scale of a few seconds, this type of observation can only be made with high time-resolution imaging devices. The auroral developments took place in the zenith above Kiruna, where they were recorded by ground-based monochromatic imagers. The subsequent poleward expansion of the activity was observed by the EISCAT incoherent scatter radar 200 km to the North of the initial activation. These observations are discussed in the light of existing substorm theories, and it is proposed that the instability responsible for the final break-up of the arc is self-destructive.},

   abstract = {The DE 2 satellite observed electric field fluctuations on the topside of the nighttime midlatitude ionosphere. They extended several hundred kilometers in the latitudinal direction with wavelengths of several tens of kilometers, and their amplitudes were a few millivolts per meter. Such fluctuations were often observed at magnetically conjugate points in the northern and southern hemispheres. These electric field fluctuations are perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. They are not accompanied by any significant plasma depletion or electron temperature variations. Magnetic field fluctuations are sometimes observed simultaneously with electric field fluctuations. We interpret that these fluctuations are caused by field-aligned currents which flow from the ionosphere in one hemisphere to the conjugate point in the other hemisphere. The power spectrum of these midlatitude electric field fluctuations follows a power law of the form Power α ƒ −n, with the spectral index n of 3.5 to 4.5, which is steeper than that of the electric field fluctuations in the high-latitude ionosphere or in the equatorial ionosphere. This phenomenon may be related to other ionospheric phenomena, for example, the F region field-aligned irregularities or spread-F, observed by ground-based methods such as the MU radar, but the relationship is not clear.},

However, observational evidence has emerged (such as the occurrence of monochromatic Pc3 waves deep in the polar cap, Pi1B pulsations associated with tail plasma flows, and ULF waves in the magnetospheres of giant planets) which indicates that some basic assumptions of this theory may be insufficient in regions with open or very extended field lines. To interpret these observations, we suggest a model describing the interaction of propagating magnetosonic and Alfvén waves in longitudinally inhomogeneous plasma. A set of equations for the amplitudes of the interacting modes with account of finite frequency effect is obtained and investigated in the WKB approximation. In the synchronization region, where the wave vectors of the two modes approach one another, a substantial part of the fast magnetosonic wave energy is converted into the Alfvén wave energy. The phases of the waves are matched in such a way that the phase difference is most favorable for wave conversion. This conversion has a resonant character which may explain the occurrence of monochromatic waves with frequencies much higher than the field line eigenfrequency.},

We use this observation to separate the total probability density of Doppler velocity and spectral width into two component distributions. This process yields the posterior probability that a signal of given Doppler velocity and spectral width is ground scatter. The resulting criterion for classification of a particular signal as ground scatter, v \{$<$\} 33.1 m/s + 0.139w \&\{\#\}8722; (0.00133 s/m)w 2, significantly reduces the probability that a signal will be erroneously classified as ionospheric scatter, while only moderately increasing the probability that an ionospheric scatter signal will be erroneously classified as ground scatter.

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive modeling investigation of ionospheric and thermospheric variations during a prompt penetration electric field (PPEF) event that took place on 9 November 2004, using the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model (TIMEGCM). The simulation results reveal complex latitudinal and longitudinal/local-time variations in vertical ion drift in the middle- and low-latitude regions owing to the competing influences of electric fields and neutral winds. It is found that electric fields are the dominant driver of vertical ion drift at the magnetic equator; at midlatitudes, however, vertical ion drift driven by disturbance meridional winds exceeds that driven by electric fields. The temporal evolution of the UT-latitude electron density profile from the simulation depicts clearly a super-fountain effect caused by the PPEF, including the initial slow-rise of the equatorial F-layer peak height, the split of the F-layer peak density, and the subsequent downward diffusion of the density peaks along magnetic field lines. Correspondingly, low-latitude total electron content (TEC) becomes bifurcated around the magnetic equator. The O/N2column density ratio, on the other hand, shows very little variations during this PPEF event, excluding composition change as a potential mechanism for the TEC variations. By using realistic, time-dependent, high-latitude electric potential and auroral precipitation patterns to drive the TIMEGCM, the model is able to successfully reproduce the large vertical ion drift of ∼120 m/s over the Jicamarca incoherent radar (IS) in Peru, which is the largest daytime ion drift ever recorded by the radar. The simulation results are validated with several key observations from IS radars, ground GPS-TEC network, and the TIMED-GUVI O/N2column density ratio. The model-data intercomparison also reveals some deficiencies in the TIMEGCM, particularly the limitations imposed by its upper boundary height as well as the prescribed O+ flux.},

  abstract = {Under geomagnetically quiet conditions, the daytime midlatitude ionosphere is mainly influenced by solar radiation: typically, electron densities in the ionosphere peak around solar noon. Previous observations from the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar (ISR) have evidenced the presence of evening electron densities higher than daytime densities during the summer. The recent development of midlatitude Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars over North America and Japan has revealed an evening enhancement in ground backscatter during the summer. SuperDARN observations are compared to data from the Millstone Hill ISR, confirming a direct relation between the observed evening enhancements in electron densities and ground backscatter. Statistics over a year of data from the Blackstone radar show that the enhancement occurs during sunset for a few hours from April to September. The evening enhancement observed by both SuperDARN and the Millstone Hill ISR is shown to be related to recent satellite observations reporting an enhancement in electron densities over a wide range of longitudes in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude sector during summer time. Finally, global results from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) and the horizontal wind model (HWM07) are presented in relation with previously published experimental results and proposed mechanisms of the evening enhancement, namely, thermospheric horizontal winds and geomagnetic field configuration. It is shown that the IRI captures the features of the evening enhancement as observed by SuperDARN radars and satellites.},

   abstract = {Long-period ground ULF waves may be controlled by the mean values of solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) parameters (velocity, density, and North-South IMF component Bz). We investigated the influence of these parameters on ground ULF power in the Pc5 range (2\&\{\#\}8211;7 mHz) during periods of quiet and during coronal mass ejection (CME) and corotating interaction region (CIR) storms from 1991 to 2004. With multiple regression and path analysis, we studied the influence of these hourly parameters as a set rather than individually. This allowed us to determine which factors were most influential and which were only correlated with influential factors. By using multiple regression, we have explained more variation in Pc5 power than has been achieved in previous studies. In both storm types (CME and CIR) and during all storm phases (initial, main phase, recovery, and a 48 h period after recovery) as well as during quiet periods, solar wind velocity and IMF Bz influenced ground Pc5 power directly. These two variables also acted on the ULF Pc5 indirectly through the intermediate parameters of Dst, and the variations in number density and IMF, although at a weaker level. Ground Pc5 power was greater during CME storms during the main phase and recovery but larger during CIR storms in the period after recovery. In addition, the effect of certain independent variables differed depending on storm type. A model such as this offers the possibility of nowcasting Pc5 power by inserting current levels of solar wind and IMF variables as predictors into the regression equation.},

The average energy of the electrons is estimated to be 4\&\{\#\}8211;8 keV, and the energy deposition is 6\&\{\#\}8211;10 mW/m2. Owing to the high latitudes it is unlikely that these electrons were energized on the nightside and adiabatically drifted to the dayside. Instead, we think that the high-latitude events are controlled by the solar wind. The precipitation appears at \&\{\#\}8764;77\&\{\#\}8211;79∞magnetic latitude and coincides with a northward turning of the interplanetary field. Owing to the uncertainties in determining the exact location of open-closed boundary we interpret the events to be caused by either KH instabilities at the inner edge of the LLBL or by lobe reconnection. In the latter case the arcs are produced by electrons accelerated by parallel electric fields resulting from converging horizontal electric fields associated with convection enhancements due to lobe reconnection at the front surface of the magnetotail. These flux tubes map to the poleward edge of the cusp. The equatorward movement is attributed to erosion of field lines as the interplanetary field turns southward with associated dayside reconnection on flux tubes with footpoints at lower latitudes.},

In the North American and European sectors, communications between amateur radio operators are a persistent and abundant source source of HF transmissions. We present the results of HF radio wave propagation experiments using amateur radio transmissions as an HF source for e-POP RRI. We detail how a distributed and autonomously operated amateur radio network can be leveraged to study HF radio wave propagation as well as the structuring and dynamics of the ionosphere over a large geographic region. In one case, the sudden disappearance of nearly two-dozen amateur radio HF sources located in the midwestern United States was used to detect a enhancement in foF2 in that same region. We compare our results to those from other more conventional radio instruments and models of the ionosphere to demonstrate the scientific merit of incorporating amateur radio networks for radio science at HF.</span></p>},

Effects of galactic cosmic rays, solar particle events, relativistic and highly relativistic electrons, and IMF sector boundary crossings are briefly mentioned as well. Geomagnetic storms disturb the lower ionosphere heavily at high latitudes and very significantly also at middle latitudes. The effect is almost simultaneous at high latitudes, while an after-effect dominates at middle latitudes. The lower thermosphere is disturbed significantly. In the mesosphere and stratosphere, the effects become weaker and eventually non-detectable. There is an effect in total ozone but only under special conditions. Surprisingly enough, correlations with geomagnetic storms seem to reappear in the troposphere, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Atmospheric electricity is affected by geomagnetic storms, as well. We essentially understand the effects of geomagnetic storms in the lower ionosphere, but there is a lack of mechanisms to explain correlations found deeper in the atmosphere, particularly in the troposphere. There seem to be two different groups of effects with possibly different mechanisms---those observed in the lower ionosphere, lower thermosphere and mesosphere, and those observed in the troposphere.},

   abstract = {Abstract Nighttime medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs), which have tilted frontal structures in the midlatitude ionosphere, are investigated by the midlatitude ionosphere electrodynamics coupling (MIECO) model in this study. It has been proposed that the electrodynamic coupling between the E and F regions plays an important role in generating MSTIDs within a few hours. An intriguing aspect of MSTIDs is that they were simultaneously observed at magnetic conjugate locations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In order to study the hemisphere-coupled electrodynamics, the MIECO model has been upgraded to consist of two simulation domains for both hemispheres in which the electrostatic potential is solved by considering electrodynamics in both hemispheres. The simultaneous occurrence of MSTIDs at the magnetic conjugate stations has clearly been reproduced when the F-region neutral wind satisfies the unstable condition in both hemispheres and a sporadic-E layer is given only at the Northern (summer) Hemisphere. Even if the unstable condition is satisfied in the summer hemisphere, an unfavorable F-region neutral wind in the winter hemisphere largely suppresses the growth of MSTIDs in both hemispheres.},

Modern ground-based ionosondes provide space weather parameters in real-time including the vertical electron density distribution up to ∼1000 km and the velocity components of the ionospheric F region drift. A global network of digisondes distributes this information in real-time via internet connections. The quality of the automatic scaling of the echo traces in ionograms was a continuous concern ever since first attempts have been reported. The modern low-power ionosonde with ∼100 W transmitters (compared to several kilowatt for the older ionosondes) relies on more sophisticated signal processing to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and to retrieve the essential ionospheric characteristics. Recent advances in the automatic scaling algorithm ARTIST have significantly increased the reliability of the autoscaled data, making the data, in combination with models, more useful for ionospheric now-casting. Vertical and horizontal F region drift velocities are a new real-time output of the digisondes. The ``ionosonde drift''is derived from the measured Doppler frequency shift and angle of arrival of ionospherically reflected HF echoes, a method similar to that used by coherent VHF and incoherent scatter radars.},

The radar has a field of view that overlooks the Antarctic Peninsula, a known hot spot of gravity wave activity. We present observations of radar ground-backscatter data, in which the signatures of MSTIDs are manifested as structured enhancements in echo power. Observed periods were in the range 30--80 min, corresponding to frequencies of 0.2--0.6 mHz. Wavelengths were generally in the range 200--800 km and phase speeds in the range 100--300 m s−1. These values are within the ranges typically associated with medium-scale gravity waves. We find a primary population of northward (equatorward) propagating MSTIDs, which demonstrate an association with enhanced solar wind-magnetosphere coupling and a smaller, westward propagating population, that could be associated with atmospheric gravity waves excited by winds over the Andean and Antarctic Peninsula mountains or by the high winds of the Antarctic Polar Vortex.},

   abstract = {Abstract Thirteen case studies of mesoscale wave disturbances (characterized by either a singular wave of depression or wave packets with periods of 1?4 h, horizontal wavelengths of 50?500 km, and surface pressure perturbation amplitudes of 0.2?7.0 mb) are reviewed to isolate common synoptic features for these cases and to shed light on possible energy sources for the waves. A strong thermal inversion in the lower troposphere (north of a frontal boundary) and a jet streak propagating toward a ridge axis in the upper troposphere are commonly observed in all the cases. In general, the area of wave activity is bounded by the jet axis to the west or northwest, a surface front to the southeast, an inflection axis (between the trough and ridge axes) to the southwest and the ridge axis to the northeast. The conditions specified by Lindzen and Tung as being necessary to form a wave duct, which include the existence of the lower-tropospheric inversion, seem to be met in many of these cases. This suggests that a ducting mechanism contributes to the long duration of these wave events by preventing the vertical propagation of wave energy. Questions are raised concerning the role of either convection or shear instability as source mechanisms for the generation of these mesoscale wave disturbances. The observed development of the waves within the exit region of a jet streak propagating toward an upper-level ridge axis is shown to be consistent with the hypothesis that the actual energy source needed to initiate and sustain thew wave events may be related to a geostrophic adjustment process associated with upper-tropospheric jet streaks.},

   abstract = {Analysis of the excitation of atmospheric gravity waves leads to a hypothesis concerning the nature of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (TID\&\{\#\}8217;s) and their relation to large-scale TID\&\{\#\}8217;s. Stationary phase techniques are used to derive the asymptotic fluctuations of velocity and electron density generated by a line source (e.g., the auroral electrojet). Dissipation by viscosity and thermal conductivity is included in an approximate manner. The gravity wave response includes a discrete spectrum of upper-atmospheric guided modes and a continuous spectrum of freely propagating waves; these two classes of waves can be associated with large-scale and medium-scale TID\&\{\#\}8217;s, respectively. The medium-scale TID\&\{\#\}8217;s, in turn, are primarily composed of two families of waves: those that propagate obliquely upward from the source and reach the F region directly and those that propagate initially downward and reach the F region only after reflection from the earth. For an E region source the earth-reflected waves appear as nearly monochromatic wave packets, whereas the direct waves appear for the most part as single pulses; this qualitative difference corresponds to J. E. Titheridge\&\{\#\}8217;s observational distinction between periodic and nonperiodic TID\&\{\#\}8217;s. It is suggested that this dichotomy may imply the dominance of upper-atmospheric (as opposed to tropospheric) sources. In this connection the average fluctuations of the auroral electrojet are shown to be sufficient to generate sizable medium-scale TID\&\{\#\}8217;s that propagate to large horizontal distances with no loss of amplitude despite the absence of ducting mechanisms. Such propagation is possible because amplitude attenuation due to cylindrical spreading is counteracted by the fact that the lower-frequency waves, which reach the F region at the greater horizontal distances, are generated with larger amplitudes. Several properties of the calculated response, including the linear increase of period and wavelength with distance from the source, might be useful in future observational studies designed to identify the sources of medium-scale TID\&\{\#\}8217;s.},

NOAA's and NASA's well-instrumented spacecraft observed the evolution of these geoeffective events from their solar origins, through the interplanetary medium, to their geospace impacts. The 6 September X9.3 flare was the largest to date for the nearly concluded solar cycle 24 and, in fact, the brightest recorded since an X17 flare in September 2005, which occurred during the declining phase of solar cycle 23. Rapid ionization of the sunlit upper atmosphere occurred, disrupting high-frequency communications in the Caribbean region while emergency managers were scrambling to provide critical recovery services caused by the region's devastating hurricanes. The 10 September west limb eruption resulted in the first solar energetic particle event since 2012 with sufficient flux and energy to yield a ground level enhancement. Spacecraft at L1, including DSCOVR, sampled the associated interplanetary coronal mass ejections minutes before their collision with Earth's magnetosphere. Strong compression and erosion of the dayside magnetosphere occurred, placing geosynchronous satellites in the magnetosheath. Subsequent geomagnetic storms produced magnificent auroral displays and elevated hazards to power systems. Through the lens of NOAA's space weather R-S-G storm scales, this event period increased hazards for systems susceptible to elevated ``radio blackout'' (R3-strong), ``solar radiation storm'' (S3-strong), and ``geomagnetic storm'' (G4-severe) conditions. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the September 2017 space weather event, and a summary of its consequences, including forecaster, post-event analyst, and communication operator perspectives.},

   abstract = {Using wind data monitored by the MU radar at Shigaraki, Japan (35$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 136$\,^\{\circ\}$E) in the three years of 1986--1988, a statistical analysis is made of inertio-gravity waves (IGWs) with short vertical wavelengths (⩽4 km) and long ground-based periods (⩾10 h) which are dominant in the lower stratosphere in all seasons. The intensity of the IGWs is at its peak in winter when a strong subtropical westerly wind jet is situated over Japan. The zonal component of vertical momentum flux associated with the IGWs in winter is mostly negative and the magnitude decreases with altitude, suggesting a strong interaction between IGWs and the background wind field. The parameters of the wave structure are estimated by a hodograph analysis, taking into consideration the effect of vertical shear of the background wind that is not negligible in winter. The obtained parameters, such as the vertical and horizontal energy propagation directions, vertical and horizontal wavelengths, and intrinsic period, are compared between two periods with a strong subtropical jet including winter and with a weak jet including summer. The degree of saturation of IGWs, defined as the ratio of amplitude of the horizontal perturbation velocity parallel to the horizontal wavenumber vector to the intrinsic horizontal phase velocity, is also statistically and directly examined using the results of wave parameter estimation. It is shown that the degree of saturation is larger in winter than in summer and that there are few oversaturated IGWs even in winter. Moreover, in order to examine the generation mechanisms of the IGWs, an analysis is made from two points of view: geostrophic adjustment of the westerly wind jet and the topographic effect. The meridional propagation direction of IGWs is examined in a section of latitude and altitude relative to the jet axis using ECMWF operational data. Most of the IGWs observed in the 12--18 km height region (above the ground) in winter propagate meridionally toward the jet axis, indicating that geostrophic adjustment at least just as the jet axis is not the main generation mechanism of the IGWs. On the other hand, the characteristics of intensive IGWs propagating westward relative to the background wind in the 18--22 km height region in winter are in good accord with mountain waves excited in strong westerly winds near the surface.},

   abstract = {We report for the first time simultaneous observations of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) at geomagnetic conjugate points in both hemispheres, using two all-sky airglow imagers at midlatitudes. A 630-nm all-sky CCD imager at Sata, Japan, detected MSTIDs with a wavefront elongated from NW to SE on the night of August 9, 2002. During this event, MSTIDs with a wavefront elongated from SW to NE were observed at the geomagnetic conjugate point, Darwin, Australia. To investigate geomagnetic conjugacy of the MSTID structures, the Darwin images were mapped The MSTID structures mapped from Darwin to its magnetic conjugate points along the geomagnetic field lines (B) coincide closely with those in the Sata images. This result suggests that polarization electric field (Ep) plays an important role in the generation of MSTIDs. Ep maps along B and moves the F region plasma upward or downward by E × B drifts, causing plasma density perturbations with structures mirrored in the northern and southern hemispheres.},

Occurrence statistics for the appearance of electron and proton particle injection at three geostationary spacecraft and for the detection of midlatitude magnetic Pi 2 pulsations in a 3-hour local time sector have been compiled from 240 hours of data. Throughout this interval a signature was detected on one or more of the instruments on average every 65 min. It is demonstrated that the detection of geostationary orbit particle injections and the detection of ground-based Pi 2 pulsations are correlated at a very high significance level, and that both appear to be effective substorm indicators. However, a small percentage of events (\&\{\#\}8764;10% in each case) may be identified as a Pi 2 event but not as an injection event or viceversa, without any obvious explanation, such as the local time of the observing instrumentation. A number of possible explanations for the discrepancies between the two data sets are discussed.},

However, using the Earth's ionosphere as a giant X-ray detector, we show the magnitude of this flare is consistent with X45 $\pm$5 (4.5 $\pm$0.5 mW/m2), or more than twice that of the two previously recorded largest flares, both about X20. This flare magnitude is determined by using the large observed phase changes recorded at Dunedin, New Zealand, on long VLF radio paths across the Pacific from transmitters in the continental USA and Hawaii. The enhanced X-ray flux caused a dramatic lowering of the height of the D-region of the ionosphere, allowing the flare to be measured relative to the GOES observations.},

The sounder deployment enabled 28 middle- and high-latitude paths to be evaluated; the time period of the study was from December 1994 until the summer of 1996. Propagation conditions including ionospheric mode information, maximum observable frequencies, signal-to-noise ratios, and channel availabilities for digital data communication were derived and archived. The objective of the study was to ascertain the efficacy of HF data link communication for a proposed aeronautical-mobile service. Data were used to simulate the propagation environment which would be experienced in actual operation and to evaluate the value of path and frequency diversity in overcoming various propagation effects. It has been concluded that path and frequency diversity will lead to channel availabilities approaching nearly 100% and that a practical engineering solution was possible. These positive results are achievable if and only if dynamic frequency management methods are invoked. The paper outlines the nature of a real-time system, which is based upon a terrestrial FMCW swept-frequency sounder constellation and by which communication nowcasts and short-term forecasts are developed to drive a dynamic frequency management system.},

A horizontal profile of electromagnetic field intensity at the E layer shows a wider spread than that of the incident wave due to trapping of the fast magnetosonic wave in the ducting layer. Since electrostatic electric field intensity of the incident Alfvén wave is dominant in the central region, the eddy Hall current associated with the Alfvén wave generates the ground magnetic field variations. On the other hand, since electromagnetic electric field intensity of the trapped fast magnetosonic wave exceeds to that of the incident Alfvén wave in the region surrounding the central region, both the magnetic field of the fast magnetosonic wave and the secondary field due to the eddy Pedersen current contribute to the ground magnetic field variations.},

  abstract = {Stratosphere-troposphere evolution associated with polar vortex intensification (VI) events is examined during the Northern Hemisphere winter. The incipient stage of a VI event is marked by anomalously low wave activity and descending westerly anomalies over the depth of the polar stratosphere. Reduced poleward planetary wave heat flux occurs as the circumpolar wind becomes strongest and pressure anomalies penetrate toward the surface. Descending pressure patterns project strongly onto the positive state of the Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode (NAM). Concurrently, anomalous poleward momentum flux develops in the upper troposphere, and the related tropospheric mean meridional circulation maintains the attendant wind and temperature anomalies against surface drag. The gross behavior of the composite VI event is similar in shape but opposite in sign to that associated with sudden stratospheric warming events (SSWs). However, the descent of the wind and temperature anomalies over the VI life cycle is generally weaker and slower than its SSW counterpart preceding the maximum vortex anomaly. Similarly, after the maximum wind event, the weakening of the winds is faster than the strengthening of the winds after a SSW. This is because stratospheric wind reduction anomalies are produced by wave driving, which can be rapid, and increases in wind speed are associated with the radiative cooling of the polar cap, which happens more gradually. While the contributions of the anomalous momentum fluxes by the quasi-stationary and synoptic eddies are similar to SSWs, the much stronger anomalous momentum flux observed during VI can be attributed to the larger role of eddies with timescales between 15 and 40 days and of wave number 2 scale. Notable differences between VI and SSW appear in the tropical region. In particular, anomalous vortex intensification seems to occur preferentially during La Niña conditions.},

   abstract = {Auroral spirals are the largest vortex structures that appear in auroral arcs. Their diameters vary from tens to hundreds of kilometers. We have collected an all-sky camera data set of 216 events including 189 northern and 27 southern hemispheric spirals. For the first time in the literature, this study shows spiral structures from both hemispheres with similar occurrence distributions for their scale sizes and a sense of rotation that is always counterclockwise when viewed along the geomagnetic field. In a few cases the time resolution was adequate to follow the winding process and the relative brightness of the spirals. These events show that the winding motion of the auroral structure is opposite to the anticipated plasma flow in the same region, and that the winding process is controlled by the intensity of the auroral precipitation. We show that these findings are consistent with the model of Hallinan \{$[$\}1976\{$]$\}. He suggested that spirals are related to periodic undulations developing in an upward field-aligned current (FAC) sheet. In this model, the winding of the auroral structure manifests the magnetic field line twisting in a direction different from the ionospheric plasma flow. We discuss Hallinan's theory in more detail: First, we derive the complete solutions of the magnetic field perturbation. Second, we compute the structure of the FAC sheet and show that it reproduces the shape and sense of rotation of auroral spirals. Third, we consider the factors that affect the amount of spiral winding. In particular, we show that the spiral winding is controlled by the strength of the FAC perturbation in the arc and thereby is related to auroral precipitation and arc brightness observed. We also find the relationship between the finite field-aligned distance required for spirals to fully evolve and the amplitude of the FAC perturbation and discuss how this relationship could be used to identify the source region for the FAC perturbation. However, the assumption of a constant background field in the model hampers detailed comparisons with observed FACs and spatial scale sizes. Further development of the model is needed before we can conclude, for example, if at the altitude of the acceleration region, the conditions would be favorable for the spiral winding mechanism.},

These irregularities can be observed for many hours and generally exhibit very low Doppler velocities. A recent collaborative experiment using the Wallops radar and the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar has determined that these irregularities are located at the ionospheric footprint of the plasmapause and in a region of opposed electron density and electron temperature gradients. We conclude that the irregularities are produced by the temperature gradient instability (TGI) or by turbulent cascade from primary irregularity structures produced from this instability. This is the first experimental confirmation that the TGI is effective in producing decameter-scale ionospheric irregularities.},

Some of the main results presented in this paper are the MSTIDs which occur at daytime in local winter and nighttime in local summer, related to the solar terminator and modulated by the solar cycle. They present equatorward (from ∼100 to 400 m/s) and westward (∼50 to 200 m/s) horizontal propagation velocities, respectively. The corresponding periods are compatible (higher) with the theoretical prediction, which is given by the neutral atmosphere buoyancy period associated with the Brunt-Väisälä frequency (about 600 s). Moreover, higher TIDs productivity is mainly associated with the downward vertical propagation. Finally, the results obtained in this study suggest the possibility of developing future MSTID models to mitigate its impact in applications like precise satellite navigation.},

Now, recent observations of ionospheric and atmospheric phenomena (particularly, but not exclusively, at midlatitudes) are suggesting that electrodynamic processes may also be important for atmospheric buoyancy waves with periods as short as a few hours. During the daytime, passive ohmic losses may be responsible for a strong azimuthal filtering of buoyancy waves which limits their propagation in the upper atmosphere to near equatorward where there is a minimum of the 
drag. At night, the active development of plasma instabilities, whose growth rate is also strongly azimuthally dependent, may not only minimize ion drag but may also feed energy into particular buoyancy waves to counteract the nighttime's enhanced molecular and thermal dissipation, thus creating a strong equatorward and westward orientation to observed traveling ionospheric disturbances. In all, the strength of the apparent coupling between buoyancy waves and ionospheric electrodynamics in the upper atmosphere may suggest the classification and study of a new form of electrohydrodynamic waves.},

Magnetic pulsations with a nearly identical waveform were observed in the same time interval at three ground stations (Aedey, L ≈6.84; York, L ≈2.55; and Hermanus, L ≈1.83), which were located near midnight, confirming that the pulsations propagated to the ground. At the satellite the pulsations had comparable radial and azimuthal components in both the magnetic and electric fields. In contrast to the observations near the magnetic equator by the Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers Charge Composition Explorer spacecraft \{$[$\}Takahashi et al., 1995\{$]$\}, no compressional component was detected in the magnetic field. The orthogonal components of the electric and magnetic fields oscillated either in phase or 180$\,^\{\circ\}$out of phase, a property of a propagating (rather than standing) wave. The Poynting flux of the Pi2 pulsations was parallel to the ambient magnetic field and directed toward the nearer ionosphere, with little indication of ionospheric reflection. This unidirectional flow of electromagnetic energy is consistent with the strong ionospheric damping of Alfvén waves estimated from a numerical calculation. It is significant that the measured Poynting flux could damp a cavity mode oscillation in ∼10 s, assuming that the previously reported equatorial compressional Pi2 pulsations represent the cavity mode. Since the transverse Pi2 pulsations at Akebono lasted ∼400 s, they cannot be due to a gradual energy leakage from a simple cavity mode oscillation. Consequently, if the observed energy flow is a general property of plasmaspheric Pi2 pulsations, a simple cavity mode oscillation excited by an impulsive source is not an appropriate model for Pi2 pulsations.},

The eclipse occurred on the afternoon of July 20 and caused a large rapid decrease in the electron temperature at all heights and a subsequent recovery. The ion temperature was seen to change at all heights almost equally rapidly, though by a smaller amount. These changes in temperature caused a rapid reduction in the value for the diffusive equilibrium scale height. As a consequence, ionization moved downward and the density at hmax increased, though at altitudes above 425 km it decreased.

Part of the signal energy penetrates the ionosphere in or near the auroral zones, and the remainder is reflected back along geomagnetic field lines and is successively amplified upon passing through the equatorial interaction region.In this note we suggest that part of the signal energy that penetrates the ionosphere is transformed (possibly through collisional processes) into the isotropic (fast) hm wave mode and then propagates horizontally in an ionospheric waveguide around the Alfvén (or phase) velocity minimum near the F2 peak. The complete propagation path is illustrated schematically in Figure 1. The suggestion of waveguide propagation is based upon the experimental results presented in the accompanying letter [Wentworth et al., 1966], which indicate hm emission propagation times on the order of seconds between widely separated stations in the same hemisphere.},

  abstract = {Short-period, small-scale gravity waves are frequently observed in nighttime airglow imaging experiments. These waves are often found to be ducted and may be confined to a thin region of altitude in the mesosphere or lower thermosphere. An apparent paradox of high-altitude ducted waves is the nature of the source; it is necessary that a ducted wave be excited in situ or have been able to tunnel into the duct from another atmospheric region. In this paper, analytical and numerical solutions are presented for simple thermally ducted gravity waves that are Doppler-shifted by constant background winds. Using a continuous analytical model, duct dispersion properties are calculated for three case studies. Using a fully nonlinear numerical model, several scenarios are explored by which a tropospheric source can excite these thermally ducted wave modes. First, we validate the analytical and numerical models for the classical case of linear wave tunneling. Second, we examine the nonlinear excitation of ducted waves due to resonant wave self-interactions associated with realistic propagation and small-scale wavebreaking, for propagation in the same direction as the wind flow. Third, we consider the case of ducted wave excitation and propagation opposite to the direction to wind flow. Specifically, where horizontal group and phase velocities exhibit opposite sign in the ground-relative frame. The results suggest that ducted waves of very short period can be excited in the lower thermosphere by tropospheric sources, via simple linear and nonlinear processes. These excitation mechanisms are likely to be robust for a range of realistic thermal and thermal-Doppler ducts.},

Low-latitude Pi2 pulsations detected on the ground at Kakioka (L = 1.25) are used as the reference signal to determine the relative amplitude and phase of the electric field oscillations detected at CRRES. The plasmapause is identified using electron density inferred from the plasma wave spectra observed on CRRES. Pi2 events at CRRES are defined to be 10-min intervals of high coherence between oscillations in the Kakioka horizontal northward magnetic field (H) and CRRES dusk-to-dawn electric field (E &#966;) components within the Pi2 band (6&#8211;25 mHz). The E &#966; component represents the poloidal oscillation of the geomagnetic field lines for satellite local times near midnight. Fifty-five high-coherence E &#966;-H Pi2 events occurred when both CRRES and Kakioka were within 3 hours of magnetic midnight. For these events CRRES was on L shells ranging from 2 to 6.5 and was either in the plasmasphere or in the close vicinity of the plasmapause, providing evidence for the plasmaspheric origin of low-latitude Pi2 pulsations. The amplitude of E &#966; varied significantly but there is an indication of a maximum near L = 4. The phase of E &#966; (relative to Kakioka H) remained near &#8722;90∞ at all distances. These properties are consistent with the radial structure of the fundamental cavity mode oscillations confined in the plasmasphere. For some events observed at L &gt; 3.5 it was also possible to determine the amplitude and phase of the compressional component B z at CRRES. In contrast to E &#966;, the phase of B z (relative to H) was clustered both at &#8764;180∞ and &#8764;0 for events occurring near the plasmapause. This observation still is consistent with the cavity mode according to a numerical simulation using a dipole magnetic field and a realistic plasmapause plasma density structure, which indicates that the node of B z is located near the plasmapause. Depending on the satellite position relative to the node, the phase can be either &#8211;180∞ or 0. A negative correlation is found between the Pi2 frequency and the distance of the plasmapause, which is additional support for the cavity mode origin of low-latitude Pi2 pulsations.},

  abstract = {The dissipation of high-frequency gravity waves (GWs) in the thermosphere is primarily due to kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity. Recently, an anelastic GW dispersion relation was derived which includes the damping effects of kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity in the thermosphere and which is valid before and during dissipation. Using a ray trace model which incorporates this new dispersion relation, we explore many GW properties that result from this dispersion relation for a wide range of thermospheric temperatures. We calculate the dissipation altitudes, horizontal distances traveled, times taken, and maximum vertical wavelengths prior to dissipation in the thermosphere for a wide range of upward-propagating GWs that originate in the lower atmosphere and at several altitudes in the thermosphere. We show that the vertical wavelengths of dissipating GWs, λz(zdiss), increases exponentially with altitude, although with a smaller slope for z > 200 km. We also show how the horizontal wavelength, λH, and wave period spectra change with altitude for dissipating GWs. We find that a new dissipation condition can predict our results for λz(zdiss) very well up to altitudes of ∼500 km. We also find that a GW spectrum excited from convection shifts to increasingly larger λz and λH with altitude in the thermosphere that are not characteristic of the initial convective scales. Additionally, a lower thermospheric shear shifts this spectrum to even larger λz, consistent with observations. Finally, we show that our results agree well with observations.},

Statistical study of high time resolution data from the SuperDARN TIGER radar in Tasmania, Australia, revealed that ULF wave signatures occur on an everyday basis with ground scatter accounting for about 60% of wave events. About half of these events exhibit high coherence across large spatial distances and are associated with ULF pulsations recorded by a ground magnetometer.

   note = {Consideration of horizontally travelling disturbances of electron densities in the F2 region of the ionosphere suggests that they are identical with the supposed vertically travelling disturbances discovered by Wells, Watts &amp; George (1946). They appear to be due to horizontally travelling atmospheric cellular waves of the type first investigated by Lamb. The theory of such waves is developed to include wind with linear vertical shear, special attention being paid to the conditions of bounding by temperature gradients. It is found that such waves appear to be the cause of the microbarometric oscillations long known in the troposphere. The theory of these is worked out in some detail, and an explanation found for Johnson's discovery that these oscillations have periods agreeing closely with Brunt's natural period of oscillation of a small element of atmosphere. In the ionosphere, the earth's magnetic field profoundly affects the observed motions of ionization in the F2 region, leading to a height gradient in the phase of these oscillatory motions. This gradient makes horizontally travelling disturbances appear to have a vertical component of motion, thus simulating vertically moving electron clouds. The bounding conditions for these cells in the F2 region appear to necessitate a value for γ, the ratio of specific heats of air, considerably less than 1·4.},

We focus on loss of relativistic electrons. We use low-altitude polar-orbiting spacecraft and analyze fluxes of tens to hundreds of keV protons and relativistic (>1.5 MeV) electrons during a moderate geomagnetic storm, with a long-lasting recovery phase (4--5 d). Using data from four local times, we find that the loss of relativistic electrons is confined within the anisotropic proton zone and that a spatially limited loss of relativistic electrons is spatially collocated with increased loss of protons. The proton pitch angle distributions within these peaks are consistent with moderate to strong pitch angle scattering due to electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves. The loss of relativistic electrons collocated with protons is found at all four local times considered (0300, 0700, 1400, 1700 MLT). Since anisotropic proton distributions can under certain conditions generate EMIC waves, we find strong indications that the observed relativistic electrons are scattered into the atmospheric loss cone by EMIC waves. EMIC wave scattering is less efficient at high equatorial pitch angles but very efficient near the loss cone, thereby controlling the loss rate of relativistic electrons to the atmosphere. Our observations in and near the loss cone support theoretical work suggesting that EMIC waves can cause scattering loss to the atmosphere of relativistic electrons over the course of a geomagnetic storm.},

   abstract = {The Stare (Scandinavian twin auroral radar experiment) auroral radar system has been used to measure ionospheric electric fields associated with Pc 5 geomagnetic pulsations. With this system, electric fields are derived from the drift velocity of radar auroral irregularities. The spatial resolution is 20 km over a 200,000-km≤grid, and the temporal resolution is 20 s. It has been found that the oscillating electric field associated with a hydromagnetic field line resonance produces poleward moving, bandlike regions of radar aurora, which are aligned in the east-west direction. The drift of the irregularities within these bands is alternately eastward and westward. The Stare electric field data have been used in conjunction with the Biot-Savart Law and an assumed height-integrated conductivity of 8-10 \&\{\#\}937;\&\{\#\}8722;1 to calculate the ground magnetic disturbance. It has been found that the H and Z are well predicted, whereas D is generally underestimated. These results are consistent with a 90∞rotation of the magnetic polarization ellipse in the ionosphere. By Fourier analyses of the Stare data it is found that the half-power latitudinal width of the field line resonance is typically 100 km in the ionosphere. Moreover, the north-south electric field undergoes a 180∞phase shift about the resonance as predicted by theory. The data have been used to estimate equatorial plasma densities for 6 \{$<$\} L \{$<$\} 7, and values of the order of 20 cm\&\{\#\}8722;3 have been obtained. However, these determinations are strongly affected by distortions of the geomagnetic field from a dipolar geometry. In summary, (1) the experimental results strongly support the hydromagnetic field line resonance theory of pulsations; (2) the magnetic polarization ellipse is indeed rotated through 90∞by the ionosphere; (3) the phenomena previously observed by auroral radar workers in association with Pc 5 pulsations were related to the electric field of the hydromagnetic wave near resonance; and (4) auroral radar measurements can be used to estimate the equatorial magnetospheric plasma density in the region 5 \{$<$\} L \{$<$\} 8.},

   abstract = {Many studies have attempted to quantify the coupling of energy from the solar wind into the magnetosphere. In this paper we parameterize the dependence of the magnetopause reconnection rate on interplanetary parameters from the OMNI data set. The reconnection rate is measured as the rate of expansion of the polar cap during periods when the nightside reconnection rate is thought to be low, determined from observations by the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) Far Ultraviolet (FUV) imager. Our fitting suggests that the reconnection rate is determined by the magnetic flux transport in the solar wind across a channel approximately 4 RE in width, with a small correction dependent on the solar wind speed, and a clock angle dependence. The reconnection rate is not found to be significantly dependent on the solar wind density. Comparison of the modeled reconnection rate with SuperDARN measurements of the cross-polar cap potential provides broad support for the magnitude of the predictions. In the course of the paper we discuss the relationship between the dayside reconnection rate and the cross-polar cap potential.},

  abstract = {A study is made of the screening effect of the atmosphere and ionosphere which lets only part of a magnetospheric micropulsation signal reach the ground. We obtain analytical expressions relating the magnetic field in the magnetosphere to that on the ground, which are confirmed by computing a full solution. Only the part of the signal with no vertical current will be seen on the ground; this agrees with previous work. Using this result, we find that the reflection condition of a transverse hydromagnetic wave incident on the top of the ionosphere indicates a [`]fixed-end' boundary condition for the field line. To a first approximation, micropulsation polarisations observed on the ground must be rotated through a right angle to obtain those in the magnetosphere. The strength of the electric field predicted in the ionosphere agrees with radio aurorae observations.},

   abstract = {On a number of occasions The Johns Hopkins University/Applied Physics Laboratory HF radar at Goose Bay, Labrador, has observed the effects of field line resonances on the drift velocities of irregularities in the F region of the high-latitude ionosphere. These resonances are seen as quasi-monochromatic oscillations in the Doppler velocities measured by the radar. One of the most interesting sets of resonances occurs near midnight MLT and may be associated with shear in the convective flow in the magnetotail. This paper discusses in detail a particularly clear example which shows field line resonances equatorward of a region of shear flow in the early morning sector. Velocity oscillations were recorded at the three discrete frequencies 1.3, 1.95, and 2.6 mHz over a 3 hour period. The motions were predominantly in the geomagnetic east-west direction, indicating north-south electric fields. As expected of field line resonance pulsations, these oscillations had pronounced peaks in their latitudinal power distribution. For the pulsation at 1.95 mHz, a latitudinal phase shift of 180∞was observed across the peaks in all the look directions of the radar, and a longitudinal wavelength corresponding to an m value of about 3 was obtained. For the 2.6-mHz pulsation, the phase shifts across the peaks had a variation with look direction that indicated a significant longitudinal as well as latitudinal variation; for this activity we estimate an m value of about 16. The pulsations could occur simultaneously but remained distinct, as the latitude of peak response was observed to vary inversely with the frequency of the pulsation. We interpret these features in terms of field line resonance theory and discuss the possible sources of the pulsation energy.},

We designate these structures as mesospheric fronts and present a detailed summary of this night series of observations, paying particular attention to the details of the different frontal structures, the wave-like activity seen throughout the night, and the background atmospheric conditions. These data are compared to other observations of similar mesospheric fronts found in the literature, and we seek to understand them in relation to mesospheric bores, ducted gravity waves, mesospheric wall events, and nonlinear gravity wave interactions. We find that the observed frontal characteristics and the atmospheric background structure exhibit a close resemblance to previous observations of mesospheric bores. Owing to this similarity, and supported by gravity wave ray-tracing experiments, we propose a sequence of events that generated the mesospheric fronts observed in the airglow emission. Furthermore, we note this similarity in atmospheric structure suggests a potential means of predicting the occurrence of such mesospheric phenomena.},

The power spectra of the observed Pi pulsations show both single and multiple peaks during daytime and nighttime. Typical periods of Pi pulsations observed are 30-100 s. The observed frequency ratios of the first three harmonics are found to be about 1\&\{\#\}8758;1.5\&\{\#\}8758;2. Large-amplitude pulsations are more frequently observed during local noon and midnight. The observed characteristics are explained on the basis of two cavity resonance models: (1) a magnetosphere cavity model (model A) that includes the plasmasphere and the plasma outside the plasmapause and (2) a plasmasphere cavity model (model B) that ignores the plasma outside the plasmapause. It is found that the presence of the plasma outside the plasmapause can significantly modify the amplitude and eigenfrequencies of the waves excited in the resonance cavity. The eigenfrequencies of the cavity waves also depend on the position and the density drop at the plasmapause. The eigenfrequencies as a function of the azimuthal wave number ky are also studied. It is found that for small ky , the ratios of the eigenfrequencies of the first three harmonics in the radial direction calculated from model A are consistent with the observed values.},

The model calculates the time evolution of the phase space distribution function in the region from 2 RE to 6.5 RE, considering losses due to charge exchange, Coulomb collisions, and plasma wave scattering along ion drift paths. The spatial regions of ion cyclotron wave instability are determined by calculating the convective growth rates for electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, integrating them along wave paths, and selecting regions of maximum wave amplification. The source regions are located on the duskside in agreement with the predominant occurrence of EMIC waves. A spectral power density of 1 nT2/Hz is adopted within the unstable regions. According to quasi-linear theory, the fluctuating fields are regarded as imposed on the system, and the losses due to wave-particle interactions are described with diffusive processes. The effects of the presence of heavy ion components on the quasi-linear diffusion coefficients are also considered. Resonance with ion cyclotron waves reduce the anisotropy of the proton population and the unstable regions disappear with time. Global patterns of precipitating ion fluxes are obtained and compared with observations.},

These errors are the result of efforts to better approximate AACGM coordinates near the magnetic equator and the South Atlantic Anomaly. In these regions AACGM coordinates are not defined and alternate coordinates have been used. This augmentation and emphasis on the solution in regions near the equator result in spherical harmonic approximating functions that are less accurate than need be in the auroral and polar regions. In response, a new set of spherical harmonic coefficients have been derived that better represent AACGM coordinates in these regions. These new AACGM coefficients are limited to below 2000 km in altitude in order to ensure accuracy. For altitudes above 2000 km, a magnetic field-line tracing solution is recommended. A software package developed to take advantage of the new AACGM coefficients provides the capability of tracing magnetic field lines at any altitude, for improved accuracy. In addition, linear interpolation between 5 year epochs is used to produce coordinates that vary smoothly over the entire period from 1965 to present. The intent of this work is to provide a more accurate procedure for determining AACGM coordinates in the auroral and polar regions for the study of magnetospheric and ionospheric processes.},

@article{Liu2010,
   abstract = {Abundant evidence has shown that ULF wave activity measured at geosynchronous orbit is well correlated with solar wind parameters, such as the solar wind velocity and dynamic pressure. However, many of the past studies were based on magnetic field measurements near the equatorial plane and thus could not unambiguously describe ULF waves, as magnetic field oscillations in the fundamental toroidal mode have a node at the magnetic equator. In this study, we use, for the first time, simultaneous electric and magnetic field measurements by Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms satellites throughout the inner magnetosphere to statistically examine the correlation between ULF wave activity in the inner magnetosphere and the solar wind parameters: velocity, dynamic pressure, and variation in dynamic pressure. On the basis of electric field observations from August 2007 to May 2009, we found that, among the three parameters, the solar wind velocity has the strongest correlation with the daily averaged Pc4 and 5 wave magnitude in 4 \&\{\#\}8764; 9 RE. For example, the correlation coefficient of \&\{\#\}948;Er (the square root of the integrated power spectral density of the radial component of the electric field) in the Pc5 frequency range with the solar wind dynamic pressure is 0.35; with the dynamic pressure variation, it is 0.42; and with the solar wind velocity, it is 0.55. However, using only magnetic field observations, the variation in dynamic pressure is best correlated, with correlation coefficients of \&\{\#\}948;Br (the square root of the integrated power spectral density of the radial component of the magnetic field) with the dynamic pressure being 0.59, with the dynamic pressure variation being 0.63 and with the solar wind velocity being 0.53. We suggest that this difference arises because toroidal and poloidal mode pulsations are not detected with the same effectiveness in the electric field and the magnetic field near the magnetic equator and/or because of the presence of broadband ULF noise. We further suggest that either directly measured or flow-derived electric field measurements are better suited in the study of the relationship between wave power of fundamental field line resonance (i.e., in Pc5 frequency range) and solar wind conditions.},

   abstract = {A detailed investigation is carried out on geomagnetic micropulsations recorded by rapid-run magnetograms during the International Geophysical Year from 17 observatories as widely distributed geo graphically as possible. A number of well-defined cases (14 Pt's and 3 Pc's) are investigated in detail. Diurnal and world-wide characteristics are derived and the equivalent overhead current systems which may give rise to the micropulsations are constructed. Many of the examples of Pt's can be divided into two groups: viz. Pt- which is a Pt associated with a negative bay in the auroral zone and Pt+ which is a Pt either associated with a positive bay or one which appears with no bay in the auroral zone. Although both groups of Pt's, with their associated bays, have different characteristics, there are many points of similarity. Both classes have more or less coherent, synchronous wave forms over a wide area, i.e. they have the same period at different stations, where they are either nearly in or out of phase. It is found that Pc's consist of two different wave bands, both occurring during the daylight hours. The first band contains shorter period Pc's (15-30 s) with maximum amplitudes of a few gammas in moderate latitudes. They are not synchronous over wide areas. The second band contains longer period Pc's (30-90 s) with maximum amplitudes in the polar regions, amounting, on occasions, to as much as a few tens of gammas. They are well synchronized round the world. Attention is drawn to the occurrence of long period, continuous, pulsations (called LPc's) which have a longer period than Pc's and usually appear simultaneously with Pc's in polar regions. The characteristics of micropulsations found in this investigation may throw some light on their origin. In this regard, a tentative discussion is given of hydromagnetic oscillations in the outer atmosphere which are excited by solar corpuscular streams.},

   abstract = {Pi 2 magnetic pulsations are frequently observed at synchronous orbit by the UCLA fluxgate magnetometer on ATS 6. Events that occurred in September 1974 have been studied by using digital power spectra and coherency analysis to determine wave characteristics. From examination of wave form and application of spectral analysis, these Pi 2 events can be divided into three types. The first is a superposition of a 100-s oscillation and a large-amplitude, higher-frequency Pi 1 activity. The second is a 100-s wave unaccompanied by Pi 1. Both types have a significant compressional component. The third is a pure transverse wave in the azimuthal component. The pure transverse waves are quite rare, while the compressional waves occur during almost every substorm. In general, if the satellite is in the local time sector 1900-0300 LT, a Pi 2 burst accompanies every onset. In addition, onsets at the satellite are associated with ground Pi 2 bursts. The peak occurrence time of the satellite Pi 2 is 2100 LT. An examination of Pi 2 polarization at the satellite suggests that a polarization reversal occurs around midnight during quiet magnetic conditions (Kp \&\{\#\}8804; 3+), left-handed premidnight and right-handed postmidnight. This result is similar to that obtained from ground-based studies at stations equatorward of the auroral electrojet. The initial perturbation in the azimuthal component of a Pi 2 event is in the same sense as the perturbations caused by substorm-associated, field-aligned currents, positive (eastward) premidnight, negative (westward) postmidnight. This observation indicates that there may be a very close association between their causative mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The characteristics of substorm-associated Pi2 pulsations observed by the SABRE coherent radar system during three separate case studies are presented. The SABRE field of view is well positioned to observe the differences between the auroral zone pulsation signature and that observed at mid-latitudes. During the first case study the SABRE field of view is initially in the eastward electrojet, equatorward and to the west of the substorm-enhanced electrojet current. As the interval progresses, the western, upward field-aligned current of the substorm current wedge moves westward across the longitudes of the radar field of view. The westward motion of the wedge is apparent in the spatial and temporal signatures of the associated Pi2 pulsation spectra and polarisation sense. During the second case study, the complex field-aligned and ionospheric currents associated with the pulsation generation region move equatorward into the SABRE field of view and then poleward out of it again after the third pulsation in the series. The spectral content of the four pulsations during the interval indicate different auroral zone and mid-latitude signatures. The final case study is from a period of low magnetic activity when SABRE observes a Pi2 pulsation signature from regions equatorward of the enhanced substorm currents. There is an apparent mode change between the signature observed by SABRE in the ionosphere and that on the ground by magnetometers at latitudes slightly equatorward of the radar field of view. The observations are discussed in terms of published theories of the generation mechanisms for this type of pulsation. Different signatures are observed by SABRE depending on the level of magnetic activity and the position of the SABRE field of view relative to the pulsation generation region. A twin source model for Pi2 pulsation generation provides the clearest explanation of the signatures observed.},

We find it useful to separate the events into two main regions: regions 1 and 2. Region 1 is the auroral oval containing boundary plasma sheath (BPS) and low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL)/cusp activities. Region 2 is equatorward of that, with a drizzle of energetic electrons from the central plasma sheath (CPS), producing a green glow. Within region 1 a well-defined transition from intense green to red-dominated auroral activity is taken as a signature of the transition between BPS and LLBL. The hydrogen emissions are seen to be associated with both BPS and LLBL. Major PPEs are uniquely related to moving auroral forms identified as being on open LLBL/cusp field lines and are likely stimulated by pulsed reconnection events.},

   abstract = {The effect of ion drag on propagation of acoustic-gravity waves in an isothermal atmospheric F region is studied. The basic assumption is that ions move only along the magnetic lines of force with a velocity equal to the component of velocity of neutrals along the same direction. If the `collision' frequency is constant as is the case near the F peak of the ionosphere, a general refractive index expression is derived. The refractive index is in general complex, indicating damping of the wave. Studies on two simple examples show that this damping is extremely large for gravity waves and still appreciable for acoustic waves. Further, this damping depends strongly on the direction of propagation. The angular preference on damping may be susceptible to experimental verification. For the case of varying `collision' frequency, an exponential height-dependent model is studied. The resulting reflection coefficient shows that reflection can be appreciable if the collision frequency is not slowly varying over one vertical wavelength.},

@article{Hsu2003,
   abstract = {The occurrence of triggered and nontriggered substorm are examined in light of current interest in such issues as substorm identification, IMF By variations, and potentially undetected small-scale solar wind perturbation. Global substorms are identified using a sudden, persistent decrease in the AL index. The onset of this global expansion is taken to be the time of the Pi 2 burst nearest in time to the beginning of the AL decrease. IMF triggers were identified both subjectively through visual scanning of the data and automatically with a computer algorithm. Both northward turnings of the IMF Bz and decreases in the amplitude of the By component were considered as possible triggers. Two different solar wind monitors were used in the investigation: IMP-8 in a circular orbit with a distance 12‚àº35 Re to the Earth-Sun line and ISEE-2 in an elliptical orbit with a distance only 5‚àº10 Re to the Earth-Sun line. The IMP-8 results show that the triggering probability does not depend on the distance of the monitor from the Earth-Sun line in the range 12‚Ä\{\`\i\}35 Re. The ISEE dataset shows that closer than 12 Re the triggering probability is the same as it is in the IMP-8 data set. Thus there appears to be no dependence of triggering on the location of the monitor provided it is within 35 Re of the Earth. We also demonstrate that including the By component does not significantly increase the probability of substorm triggering. Approximately 60% of all substorms appear to be triggered. Of the 40% for which we could not identify a trigger, 10% occurred while the IMF was northward. The data suggest that substorm onset is a consequence of an internal magnetospheric instability that is highly sensitive to changes in magnetospheric convection induced by a sudden change in the IMF, but that these changes are not always necessary.},

These waves are associated with auroral activity, and their spatial structure reflects the time history of the auroral electrojet. The medium scale gravity waves tend to propagate to mid-latitudes on the nightside. On the dayside their range is limited to high latitudes. Gravity waves are carriers of auroral energy to middle and low latitudes where they may cause irreversible changes in temperature via viscous dissipation. Since auroral activity occurs frequently, it is suggested that this energy reaches the mid-latitude region of the thermosphere much more frequently than is indicated by planetary magnetic indices.},

The new technique allows Doppler velocities to be determined from every 200 ms multipulse sequence transmitted by the radar (equivalent to a 5 Hz measurement rate). To our knowledge, this is the highest Doppler measurement rate that has ever been attained with ionospheric radars. Tests of the new technique with the Wallops radar and Ottawa magnetometer revealed bursts of subauroral electric and magnetic field pulsations with periods of 13\&\{\#\}8211;20 s during a substorm expansion phase. These results indicate that SuperDARN measurements can be used to study highly dynamic processes in the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system, including storm and substorm electrodynamics, short-period pulsations and short-term variability in Joule heating.},

   abstract = {A multipoint analysis of conjugate magnetospheric and ionospheric flow vortices during the formation of the substorm current wedge (SCW) on 19 February 2008 is presented. During the substorm, four Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft were located close to the neutral sheet in the premidnight region between 9 and 12 R E geocentric distance, of which three closely (\&\{\#\}8764;1\&\{\#\}8211;2 R E ) clustered at \&\{\#\}8764;23 MLT and one was farther west at \&\{\#\}8764;21 MLT. The closely clustered spacecraft were engulfed by a counterclockwise plasma flow vortex, while the single spacecraft recorded a clockwise plasma flow vortex. Simultaneously, a pair of conjugate flow vortices with clockwise and counterclockwise rotation appeared in the ionosphere, as inferred from equivalent ionospheric currents. The counterclockwise space vortex, which corresponded to a downward field-aligned current, was at least 1\&\{\#\}8211;2 R E in diameter and had rotational flow speeds of up to 900 km/s. Current density estimates associated with the formation of the space vortex in the first 30 s yielded 2.8 nA/m2 (14 \&\{\#\}956;A/m2 mapped to the ionosphere), or a total current of 1.1 ◊105 A. Model calculations based on midlatitude ground magnetometer data show a gradual increase of the field-aligned current, with 1\&\{\#\}8211;2 ◊105 A within the first minute and a peak value of 7 ◊105 A after 10 min, associated with the SCW, and a matching meridian of the downward current of the SCW and the downward current (counterclockwise) space vortex. The combined ground and space observations, together with the model results, present a scenario in which the space vortices generated the field-aligned current of the SCW at the beginning of the substorm expansion phase and coupled to the ionosphere, causing the ionospheric vortices.},

@article{Sofko2000,
   abstract = {It is known that Joule heating caused by currents associated with enhanced electric fields in the auroral ionosphere can generate gravity waves. Some modeling studies found that each short-lived (∼10 min) electric field enhancement in the ionosphere leads to the generation of a single gravity wave pulse. Observational evidence of such single wave pulses has been reported in the ground-scatter echoes seen by the SuperDARN HF radars. In this paper, we present new SuperDARN observations which show that, under certain conditions, each electric field enhancement can generate a pair of gravity waves. On December 2, 1998, the IMF Bz had a perturbation with a period of ∼100 min and caused oscillations in the ionospheric electric field at the same period. Each positive or negative half-cycle of the oscillating electric field gave rise to one Joule heating enhancement which, in turn, generated a pair of gravity waves (two wave pulses). Six successive gravity wave pairs were observed. We suggest that the reason for two gravity wave pulses was that the Joule heating events in the present case were of longer duration than those in the previous events. We also show that the periodic velocities seen in the far-range ionospheric echoes are due to the direct auroral electric field modulation and not to indirect modulation caused by the equatorward-moving gravity waves.},

  abstract = {This paper presents observations and numerical simulations of ionospheric and thermospheric disturbances associated with a moderate geomagnetic storm on 10 September 2005. During the event, the incoherent radars located in Millstone Hill and Arecibo observed a dayside positive storm phase as manifested by the enhanced electron density in the F region. The universal time (UT)-altitude profile of electron density measured by both radars displayed a structure that closely resembles the Greek letter Λ. A similar structure is also reproduced by the Thermosphere-Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM). This peculiar electron density distribution is found to be associated with vertical ion drift, which initially was upward and then became downward. Using realistic time-dependent ionospheric convection and auroral precipitation as inputs, the TIEGCM reveals that the primary cause of the positive storm response was the enhanced meridional neutral wind rather than the penetration magnetospheric electric field. This study reiterates the importance of neutral wind effects on ionospheric disturbance.},

We found that MSTIDs can be categorized into three types. One type is daytime MSTIDs, which frequently occur in winter and equinoxes. Since most of the daytime MSTIDs propagated southeastward, we speculate that the daytime MSTIDs could be caused by atmospheric gravity waves in the thermosphere. A second type is nighttime MSTIDs, which frequently occur in summer. Nighttime MSTIDs propagate southwestward. This propagation direction is consistent with the idea that polarization electric fields could play an important role in generating nighttime MSTIDs. The third is dusk MSTIDs, which frequently occur in summer and propagate northwestward. Dusk MSTIDs could be caused by gravity waves originating from the sunset terminator because they have wavefronts almost parallel to the sunset terminator.},

  abstract = {During solar eclipses, the moon's shadow causes a large reduction in atmospheric energy input, including not only the stratosphere but also the thermosphere and ionosphere. The eclipse shadow has a supersonic motion which is theoretically expected to generate atmospheric bow-waves, similar to a fast-moving river boat, with waves starting in the lower atmosphere and propagating into the ionosphere. However, previous geographically limited observations have had difficulty detecting these weak waves within the natural background atmospheric variability, and the existence of eclipse-induced ionospheric waves and their evolution in a complex coupling system remain controversial. During the 21 August 2017 eclipse, high fidelity and wide coverage ionospheric observations provided for the first time an oversampled set of eclipse data, using a dense network of Global Navigation Satellite System receivers at ∼2000 sites in North America. We show the first unambiguous evidence of ionospheric bow-waves as electron content disturbances over central/eastern US, with ∼1 hour duration, 300--400 km wavelength and 280 m/s phase speed emanating from and tailing the totality region. We also identify large ionospheric perturbations moving at the supersonic speed of the maximum solar obscuration which are too fast to be associated with known gravity wave or large scale traveling ionospheric disturbance processes. This study reveals complex interconnections between the Sun, Moon, and Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere, and demonstrates persistent coupling processes between different components of the Earth's atmosphere, a topic of significant community interest.},

   abstract = {On the basis of ∼2 years of Geotail data, we use a superposed epoch approach to study the average behavior of plasma and magnetic fields at different radial distances, between 11 and 31 RE, during 66 substorms in the premidnight sector. Magnetic field dipolarization is first seen in the innermost region (11--16 RE) around substorm onset and subsequently moves tailward at a rate of 35 km/s. Fast earthward and tailward ion bulk flows in the central plasma sheet indicate that during substorm expansion the near-Earth neutral line is located between 21 and 26 RE, with a tendency to be closer to 21 RE near substorm onset. About 45 min after onset, the tailward moving dipolarization front reaches the distance range where the near-Earth neutral line is located. Thereafter the near-Earth neutral line disappears beyond 31 RE. This is the classical signature of the start of the recovery phase. We conclude that substorm recovery sets in when the tailward moving dipolarization front reaches the near-Earth neutral line, because the near-Earth neutral line cannot operate in a dipolar field geometry.},

  abstract = {We present simultaneous measurements of flow velocities inside a subauroral polarization stream (SAPS) made by six midlatitude high-frequency SuperDARN radars. The instantaneous observations cover three hours of universal time and six hours of magnetic local time (MLT). From velocity variations across the field-of-view of the radars we infer the local 2D flow direction at three different longitudes. We find that the local flow direction inside the SAPS channel is remarkably constant over the course of the event. The flow speed, however, shows significant temporal and spatial variations. After correcting for the radar look direction we are able to accurately determine the dependence of the SAPS velocity on magnetic local time. We find that the SAPS velocity variation with magnetic local time is best described by an exponential function. The average velocity at 00 MLT was 1.2 km/s and it decreased with a spatial e-folding scale of two hours of MLT toward the dawn sector. We speculate that the longitudinal distribution of pressure gradients in the ring current is responsible for this dependence and find these observations in good agreement with results from ring current models. Using TEC measurements we find that the high westward velocities of the SAPS are - as expected - located in a region of low TEC values, indicating low ionospheric conductivities.},

The effect of the eclipse was detected in diurnal variations and more distinctly in the variations of TEC along individual satellite passes. The trough-like variations with a gradual decrease and followed by an increase of TEC at the time of the eclipse were observed over a large region. The depression of TEC amounted to 3--4 TECU. The maximum depression was observed over all stations located at the maximum path of the solar eclipse. The delay of a minimum level of TEC with respect to the maximum phase of the eclipse was about 20--30 min. The two-dimensional TEC maps constructed with high temporal resolution (5-min interval) show that the eclipse produced remarkable changes in the structure of the ionosphere. These TEC maps demonstrate also that the depression of TEC reached 20--30% compared to a quiet day (October 4, 2005). The complex pattern in the spatio-temporal TEC distribution presents the important role in the dynamic processes in the ionosphere during the eclipse.},

While there are extensive networks of ground sites that sample the vertical distribution, we have rather poor coverage over the oceans and in parts of the southern hemisphere. Our ability to validate the ionospheric models is limited by the lack of point measurements and those measurements that essentially constitute characterization of horizontal gradients. In this talk, we discuss and demonstrate the use of various types of crowd-sourced information that enables us to extend our coverage over these regions. We will discuss new sources of these data, concepts for new experiments and the use of these data in assimilative models.

@article{Lui1996,
   abstract = {Observations and models of current disruption in the Earth's magnetosphere are briefly reviewed. At the approach of current disruption onset, the cross-tail current sheet shows a rapid growth in the current density, a large upsurge in the duskward ion bulk speed to nearly the ion thermal speed, an increase in the plasma pressure and its isotropy, a rise in the plasma beta, and a decrease in the current sheet thickness to a length scale comparable to the thermal ion gyroradius. During current disruption, there are (1) large changes in the local magnetic and electric fields, (2) significant magnetic and electric fluctuations over a broad frequency range, (3) magnetic field-aligned counterstreaming electron beams, (4) ion energization perpendicular to the magnetic field, and (5) reduction in the cross-tail current by an amount similar to that built up during the growth phase. Observations further indicate that regions of local reversal of the north-south magnetic field component are not necessarily sites of intense particle energization. Remote sensing of disruption activities shows that at least some current disruptions are not caused by a disturbance propagating earthward from the tail beyond 10 RE downstream. The timescale involved is comparable to or shorter than the ion gyroperiod. Current disruption thus has spatial and temporal scales outside the MHD regime. Several models for current disruption are briefly discussed. Two roles are considered for the cross-field current instability proposed for current disruption. It can provide anomalous resistivity for magnetic reconnection as advocated by the traditional viewpoint or act singly to instigate global changes of the magnetosphere during the initial substorrn expansion phase. The latter role is elaborated by showing that the instability may modify significantly the local current density and any such process will alter the force equilibrium in the current sheet and give rise to an efficient plasma and energy transport on a global scale. Furthermore, such a process can generate field-aligned current with intensity comparable to those associated with an auroral breakup arc at substorrn expansion onset. This scenario leads to a new emphasis that in addition to magnetic reconnection, rapid conversion of magnetic energy into particle energy in magnetotail systems may take place without a magnetic X line or separatrix playing the key role in energy conversion.},

@article{Samson1983,
   abstract = {This paper outlines the connection between pure states, polarized waves, and principal components in the spectral representation of multichannel or multivariate geophysical time series. If a wave is a pure state or a polarized wave (e.g. a teleseismic P-wave), the multidimensional spectral representation can be reduced to a one-dimensional spectral representation. The objective of this paper is to develop estimators of the spectral representations of these pure states, which are based on a number of optimality criteria. If nothing is known about the noise in the data, then an estimator similar to the principal components of real multivariate analysis is most useful. If some knowledge of the spectral density matrix of the noise is available, then a number of other optimality criteria can be used. Minimization of the prediction error in the spectral representation of the pure states leads to estimators similar to those used to estimate factor-scores in factor-analytic methods. These estimators of the spectral representations of polarized waves should be extremely useful to the geophysical experimenter because they allow a more objective evaluation of the parameters of the wave, and because they allow the multichannel data to be filtered to extract polarized waves, without specific knowledge of the type of polarization (e.g. elliptical or linear, and orientation of polarization ellipse). Some practical examples using spectral representations of ULF (1--20 mHz) magnetic fields are given in order to illustrate the usefulness of these methods in interpreting multichannel data.},

   abstract = {We investigate a substorm on 3 October 2004 during which 11 satellites were located in near-Earth magnetotail (X GSM > ‚à\{\'\i\}10 R E). Double Star 1 (TC-1), Cluster, and LANL-97 satellites were closely aligned in the dawn-dusk direction (<1 R E apart) for this conjunction. After substorm expansion onset, TC-1 observed plasma sheet thinning at X ‚âà‚à\{\'\i\}5.5 R E and later detected signature of plasma flow shear that may be associated with an auroral arc. Analysis of the dawn-dusk magnetic perturbations from GOES-10 and Polar suggests that these could be caused by a substorm current system consisting of not only the azimuthal closure of field-aligned currents (the substorm current wedge) but also the meridional closure of field-aligned currents. The temporal sequence of substorm activity (particle injection, current disruption, and dipolarization) revealed by these satellites indicates that the substorm expansion activity was initiated close to the Earth and spread later to further downstream distances. Furthermore, TC-1 and Cluster data show that there is no close relationship between some dipolarizations and Earthward plasma flows in the near-Earth region. The overall development of substorm activity is in agreement with the near-Earth initiation model for substorms. A temporal evolution of the magnetic field reconfiguration and plasma boundary motion during this substorm is constructed from these observations.},

  abstract = {A gravity wave anelastic dispersion relation is derived that includes molecular viscosity and thermal diffusivity to explore the damping of high-frequency gravity waves in the thermosphere. The time dependence of the wave amplitudes and general ray trace equations are also derived. In the special case that the thermal structure is isothermal and the Prandtl number (Pr) equals 1, exact linear solutions are obtained. For high-frequency gravity waves with ωIr/N ≪ 1 an upward propagating gravity wave dissipates at an altitude given by ≃ z1 + H ln(ωIr/2H∣m∣3ν1), where H is the density scale height, N is the buoyancy frequency, ν1 is the viscosity at z = z1, and ωIr and m are the gravity wave intrinsic frequency and vertical wave number, respectively. Thus high-frequency gravity waves with large vertical wavelengths dissipate at the highest altitudes, resulting in momentum and energy inputs extending to very high altitudes. We find that the vertical wavelength of a gravity wave with an initially large vertical wavelength decreases significantly by the time it dissipates just below where it begins to reflect. The effect of diffusion on a gravity wave is similar to the effect of shear in the sense that as the molecular viscosity and thermal diffusivity increase due to decreasing background density, the intrinsic frequency plus mν/H decreases and the vertical wave number increases in order to satisfy the dispersion relation for Pr = 1. We also briefly explore the results with different Prandtl numbers using numerical ray tracing. Gravity waves in a Pr = 0.7 environment dissipate just a few kilometers below those in a Pr = 1 environment when H = 7 km, showing the utility of the analytic, Pr = 1 solutions.},

In cases where substantial (i.e., large horizontal scale) movement of the vortex is observed, it is noted that regional middle atmospheric Arctic temperatures can change by tens of degrees. In other cases, we show that even very subtle (i.e., small horizontal scale) movement of the vortex system over similar timescales can result in notable temperature changes in the regional middle atmosphere. It appears that the observed events are dependant on the location, strength, and structure of the polar vortex and Aleutian High. All of these synoptic scale measurements indicate a change in the local dynamical structure of the middle atmosphere and are discussed in regards to this issue.},

However, their direct measurement is difficult and so they are normally traced by their ionospheric signatures, the Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs). These can be routinely observed, especially with incoherent scatter radars like the EISCAT-facility, which measure all the fundamental ionospheric parameters. In order to reliably infer AGW parameters from TID data, however, one needs to know the physics of the AGW-TID relationship as comprehensively as possible. We investigated this relationship by means of one-to-one comparison of theoretical model results with EISCAT data for several TID events. The relevant physics, the modeling procedure and the results of the comparisons are discussed. As a representative example, one typical event is presented in some detail. We found that the AGW-TID relationship can be quantitatively understood by means of careful physical modeling. A particular simulated TID shows quantitative consistency with a particular TID in EISCAT data only for a quite specific model-AGW ; thus, comprehensive AGW infonnation can be deduced by our method. We conclude that our use of TID `polarization information'along a single incoherent scatter beam is basically as valuable for the unique determination of a causative AGW as is traditional TID `propagation/dispersion information'. The latter, however, requires several distributed stations. Finally, we address the possibility that radars like EISCAT could be used in future WAGS (Worldwide AGW Study) campaigns to provide almost real-time information on AGW activity for the benefit of mid-latitude monitoring stations.},

  abstract = {The open-closed magnetic field line boundary (OCB) is an important indicator of magnetospheric dynamics and can be used to identify locations of particle precipitation at the edge of the magnetosphere. The OCB can fluctuate during geomagnetic events, and the extent of this variability is a vital component of space weather research and modeling. There was a unique opportunity to identify and study the synoptic variability of the OCB during the extended 2007--2009 solar quiet period through use of the Polar Experiment Network for Geophysical Upper-atmosphere Investigations--Automatic Geophysical Observatory (PENGUIn-AGO) network of ground-based fluxgate magnetometers on the Antarctic continent. The fluxgates, which measured the occurrence of standing Pc5 modes on closed field magnetic field lines, allowed for identification of the OCB structure and study of the synoptic behavior of the OCB before and during a corotating interaction region (CIR)-driven magnetic storm. Observations were compared with results from the BATSRUS space weather model and show 83% agreement for over ∼2 days before the CIR event. It is shown that such synoptic magnetometer data sets of the OCB during these storms allow for a careful test of current space weather models. The current study investigates the pre--storm time period, while a future paper will address the storm time evolution of the OCB.},

Maxwellian energy parameters (peak energy and total energy flux) are derived from the auroral spectroscopic emissions according to the conventional photometric method. We theoretically estimate CNA from the derived Maxwellian spectra and compare it with the observed CNA. The difference between the estimated CNA and the observed (\&\{\#\}948;CNA) is used as an indicator of the difference in high-energy electron flux (E \{$>$\} \&\{\#\}8764;20 keV) between the actual energy distribution and Maxwellian. This analysis is carried out for two substorm events in the evening sector to show the temporal and spatial variations of the energy spectra. Event 1 exhibits two arcs of CNA during the growth phase of the substorm. The results for this event suggest that the energy spectra of the two CNA arcs have different shapes, and this difference is revealed in the precipitating electron flux quasi-simultaneously measured by NOAA-17. Event 2 is a typical substorm that consists of growth, expansion, and recovery phases. The \&\{\#\}948;CNA changes throughout the course of the substorm, which can be consistently explained by the energy spectrum variation of the precipitating electrons measured in previous studies. Furthermore, the energy spectra consistent for both optical and CNA data are estimated by assuming a kappa or a Gaussian distribution. This estimation method based on ground observations of the energy spectra has the potential to provide significant information on substorms.},

@article{Huang1998,
   abstract = {One of principal objectives in studies of atmospheric gravity waves is to identify their sources. It has been hypothesized for many years that variations of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) can result in occurrence of the auroral electrojets in the high-latitude ionosphere and the auroral electrojets can generate gravity waves, but identification of this relationship in experiments has been difficult since gravity waves are generally observed far from the source region. In this paper, we present simultaneous observations of the IMF, auroral electrojets, and gravity waves on December 7, 1994. It is found that when the IMF Bz component turned southward, auroral electrojet currents appeared after a time delay of about 9 min. The Saskatoon HF radar observed quasiperiodic gravity waves after each burst of the auroral electrojet with a time delay of about 60--70 min. The IMF southward turnings, the auroral electrojets, and the gravity waves had a recurrence period of about 40 min. These observations show clearly the cause and effect relationship between the IMF southward turnings, the auroral electrojets, and the gravity waves. Another important phenomenon observed in this event is that the quasiperiodic occurrence of the gravity wave pulses in far-field points was determined by the repetitive energy input in the source region rather than by the wave dispersion. It seems that each burst of the auroral electrojet generated a single gravity wave pulse.},

   abstract = {We examine six near-Earth dipolarization events during which rapid flows were observed by Geotail at distances between 8 and 15 RE in the magnetotail. Each flow event was associated with local dipolarization, auroral arc brightening, and Pi2 pulsations (periods of 40--150 s). Variations in earthward flow velocity delayed by 60--90 s match the Pi2 waveforms on the ground at low latitudes on the flank. We conclude that low-latitude Pi2 pulsations are directly driven by compressional pulses associated with braking of oscillatory earthward flows. In addition, we identify a new type of nightside Pi2, which is related to the oscillatory braking current that modulates the current in the substorm current wedge. For one event we estimate the magnitude of the braking current from the amplitude of ground perturbations and find I∼2--3×104 A. An independent calculation of the inertial current using the flow measurements yields 6×104 A. We separate Pi2 into three distinct physical types: low-latitude directly driven, nightside transient response, and nightside inertial current. We propose a phenomenological model linking flow bursts, the substorm current wedge, and the three types of Pi2 pulsations.},

The passage of the 100km wide, super-sonic lunar shadow offered the opportunity to examine the changes in electron densities, radio absorption, neutral wind patterns and the possible generation of waves in the layers of the ionosphere. All these for an event for which the cause of the disturbance can be calculated with accuracy. Reported here are the results from the vertical ionosondes located under the path of totality and in the partial eclipse region and dual frequency GPS TEC measurements. The ionosondes showed that even in the partial shadow the peak electron densities of the F & E ionospheric layers decreased by as much as 20--35%. The TEC measurements showed that the vertical equivalent line integrated electron density dropped by 15% at the 97% partial eclipse north of the path of totality. The consequences of these observations are discussed in relation to making model predictions.},

   abstract = {The latitude dependence of the changes in the ionosphere total electron content (TEC) has been studied during 12 magnetic storms. TEC observations were obtained at Hamilton, Massachusetts, and Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Definite latitude differences are observed in the TEC responses during the magnetic storms: both TEC enhancements and TEC depletions are observed at Hamilton, while only enhancements are measured at Arecibo. A pre-local midnight TEC `ledge' is frequently observed in the Arecibo storm data but is seldom observed in the higher-latitude Hamilton data. These enhanced ledges in the Arecibo TEC, together with the nighttime TEC depletions measured at Hamilton, produce large south-to-north differences in the ionosphere TEC. The ledges at Arecibo may arise from electrodynamic drift effects associated with westward electric fields; the role of the motion term in the continuity equation for the TEC is assessed under these conditions. The local evening enhancements in the TEC during certain large storms are discussed in the context of the latitude dependence of the storm time magnetic field variations measured from Great Whale River to San Juan. It is shown that the large TEC enhancements appear to be associated with large positive geomagnetic bays at middle to high latitudes.},

A realistic geomagnetic field geometry is used. Sample simulations for solar maximum equinox conditions illustrate two previously predicted effects of the feedback. Near the magnetic equator, the afternoon uplift of the ionosphere by an eastward electric field reduces ion drag on the neutral wind, so that relatively strong eastward winds can occur in the evening. In addition, a vertical electric field is generated by the low-latitude wind, which produces east-west plasma drifts in the same direction as the wind, further reducing the ion drag and resulting in stronger zonal winds.},

The analysis allows a local estimate of the magnitude of gravity wave momentum flux as a function of geographic location and height on a daily basis. We examine global distributions of these gravity wave properties in the monthly mean and on an individual day, and we also show sample instantaneous wave events observed by HIRDLS. The results are discussed in terms of previous satellite and radiosonde observational analyses and middle atmosphere general circulation model studies that parameterize gravity wave effects on the mean flow. The high vertical and horizontal resolution afforded by the HIRDLS measurements allows the analysis of a wider range of wave vertical and horizontal wavelengths than previous studies and begins to show individual wave events associated with mountains and convection in high detail. Mountain wave observations show clear propagation to altitudes in the mesosphere.},

The most pronounced feature is a large northward/upward electric field in the heart of the structure. The latter is identical to the radially outward field reported for mid-latitude conjugate electric fields [Saito et al., 1995], found to trace the poleward edge of the equatorial anomaly. We favorably compare the Arecibo drift to a typical satellite event. These electric fields may reflect a nonlinear evolved state of the Perkins instability or some, as yet, unexplained coupling between atmospheric motion and the plasma embedded in it. We show here that the F-region Pedersen conductivity is much lower in these structures than outside and suggest that this is related to a polarization electric field inside the structure.},

  abstract = {Observational analyses of gravity waves in the stratosphere have revealed various climatological patterns in gravity wave activity. Seasonal, geographical, and vertical variations have all been observed. In this work, a linear model of gravity wave propagation is applied to investigate the underlying causes of some of the observed patterns. A collection of monochromatic gravity waves that represent a broad spectrum of wavenumbers and frequencies is input at 6-km altitude in the model. Propagation of the waves through realistic background atmospheric wind and stability fields is treated with linear ray theory and a simple saturation condition to limit amplitudes to stable values. The wave spectrum at the 6-km source height is specified to be constant at all latitudes, longitudes, and times, so the variability that appears at higher altitudes is due entirely to background atmosphere variations. Before the model results are compared to the observations, the spectrum of waves is filtered in a way that mimics the limitations of each of the observation techniques. The filtering is described in terms of vertical wavelength and is referred to as the ``observational filter.'' In a vertically varying background wind, gravity waves are Doppler-shifted in intrinsic frequency and refracted to different vertical wavelengths as they propagate vertically through the atmosphere. The observational filter and the wave refraction effects can thus couple in interesting ways that have not been explicitly considered in previous work. The model shows that this coupling can give rise to geographical, seasonal, and vertical variations in gravity wave observations without any variations in the spectrum or amplitude of gravity wave sources in the troposphere. Thus careful consideration of both the background wind profile and observational filter can greatly affect the interpretation of the observed climatological patterns in gravity wave activity.},

Single satellite observations show that the average duration of BBFs selected by the criterion of Angelopoulos et al. is 604 s, while multisatellite observations show that the average duration of BBFs is 1105 s. Single satellite sometimes misses the BBFs. The missing ratio of single satellite is 22.4% for the criterion of Angelopoulos et al. and 44.9 % for the criterion of Raj et al. Therefore the single satellite observations cannot tell the true number of BBFs. The multisatellite observations are more important for the criterion of Raj et al. The single satellite observations also show that 22% of substorms are not accompanied by BBFs, while multisatellite observations show that only 4.5% of substorms are not accompanied by BBFs. Thus it seems possible that all substorms are accompanied by BBFs. The occurrence frequency of RCEs in the central plasma sheet obtained by multisatellites is 12.2%. The occurrence frequency of BBFs in the central plasma sheet is 9.5% for single satellite observations and 19.4% for multisatellite observations. So BBFs may contribute more to the transport of magnetic flux, mass, and energy than what was estimated by previous studies based on single satellite observations.},

@article{KelleyFukao1991,
   abstract = {In a companion paper, data from the MU radar have been presented which show that during sunspot minimum conditions in Japan the mid-latitude ionosphere is sometimes characterized by regions of rapid and turbulent upwelling. In this paper we explore possible mechanisms for these events. The most likely process seems to be the instability of the equilibrium which occurs when the mid-latitude plasma is supported against gravity either by an eastward electric field component or by a southward neutral wind, as was proposed by Perkins (1973). We show, for example, that the growth rate determined by Perkins is considerably higher in sunspot minimum conditions than at sunspot maximum for comparable altitudes of the ionospheric F layer. The growth rate is not very large, however, and we argue here that the observed structures must evolve from preexisting undulations of the bottomside of the F region which are generated by gravity waves. That is, the gravity waves create finite amplitude structures which are amplified by the plasma instability. An intriguing feature of the gravity wave role in this process is that the echoing patches detected by the MU radar and the height bands detected by the Arecibo radar, which we believe to be related phenomena, all seem to propagate to the west. This is the same direction reported for the angle-of-arrival measurements of classic mid-latitude spread F by a number of researchers using ionosonde techniques. Since the MU radar detects the upwelling regions from nonthermal 3-m irregularities there must be mechanism to create such tracers. We propose that secondary structures are created at intermediate scales via the E×B instability operating on the dome of the upwelling structure and by the neutral wind-driven process on either the west or the east wall of the structure, depending on the direction of the zonal wind. The 3-m waves are then created in a cascade process which brings energy into a range of k space in which the structures are linearly damped. Finally, we discuss the fine structure of the echoing patches and suggest several plausible mechanisms, two of which involve E region coupling and one which deals with the vertical structure of the gravity wave seeding process.},

   abstract = {Seasonal dependence of medium-scale atmospheric gravity waves is examined in SuperDARN HF radar data and through analysis of the gravity wave dispersion relation. We found that the probability of gravity wave observation in the HF radar data is highest in winter months and lowest in summer months. The winter probability of observation in a given 2-hour period with sufficient amounts of ground backscatter peaks at about 0.8, while in the summer the probability remains near 0.4. Examination of the dispersion relation shows that there is a seasonal dependence to the altitude profile of the gravity wave's vertical wavelength that may lead to a seasonally dependent reflection of the waves resulting from the mesospheric temperature gradient. The dispersion relation predicts that for waves of a given horizontal wavelength, the minimum wave period that may be transmitted through the mÈsosphËre is longer in the summer than in the winter; the longer the wavelength, the longer the minimum period. Thus some waves that are transmitted through the mesosphere in the winter may not be transmitted in the summer. This seasonal dependence predicted from the dispersion relation is consistent with the HF radar observations.},

The effects of gravity waves on the large-scale circulation have long been treated via parametrizations in both climate and weather-forecasting applications. In these parametrizations, key parameters describe the global distributions of gravity-wave momentum flux, wavelengths and frequencies. Until recently, global observations could not define the required parameters because the waves are small in scale and intermittent in occurrence. Recent satellite and other global datasets with improved resolution, along with innovative analysis methods, are now providing constraints for the parametrizations that can improve the treatment of these waves in climate-prediction models. Research using very-high-resolution global models has also recently demonstrated the capability to resolve gravity waves and their circulation effects, and when tested against observations these models show some very realistic properties. Here we review recent studies on gravity-wave effects in stratosphere-resolving climate models, recent observations and analysis methods that reveal global patterns in gravity-wave momentum fluxes and results of very-high-resolution model studies, and we outline some future research requirements to improve the treatment of these waves in climate simulations.

With the recent augmentation of the northern hemisphere component to six radars, a sizable fraction of the entire convection zone (approximately one-third) can be imaged nearly instantaneously (\&\{\#\}8764;2 min). To date, the two-dimensional convection velocity has been mapped by combining line-of-sight velocity measurements obtained from pairs of radars within common-volume areas.

The addition of data from a statistical model constrains the solution in regions of no data coverage. For low-order expansions the results provide a gross characterization of the global convection. We discuss the processing of the radar velocity data, the factors that condition the fitting, and the reliability of the results. We present examples of imaging that demonstrate the response of the global convection to variations in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). In the case of a sudden polarity change from northward to southward IMF, the convection is seen to reconfigure globally on very short (\{$<$\}6 min) timescales.},

@article{Jakowski2008,
   abstract = {An annular eclipse occurred over Europe in the morning hours of 3 October 2005. The well-defined obscuration function of the solar radiation during the eclipse provided a good opportunity to study the ionospheric/thermospheric response to solar radiation changes. Since the peak electron density behavior of the ionospheric F2 layer follows the local balance of plasma production, loss and transport, the ionospheric plasma redistribution processes significantly affect the shape of the electron density profile. These processes are discussed here based on a comparison of vertical incidence sounding (VS) and vertical total electron content (TEC) data above-selected ionosonde stations in Europe. The equivalent slab thickness, derived with a time resolution of 10 min, provides relatively good information on the variation of the electron density profile during the eclipse. The computations reveal an increased width of the ionosphere around the maximum phase. As indicated by the available measurements over Spain, the photo production is significantly reduced during the event leading to a slower increase of the total ionization in comparison with the neighboring days. The supersonic motion of the Moon's cool shadow through the atmosphere may generate atmospheric gravity waves that propagate upward and are detectable as traveling ionospheric disturbances at ionospheric heights. High-frequency (HF) Doppler shift spectrograms were recorded during the eclipse showing a distinct disturbance along the eclipse path. Whereas the ionosonde measurements at the Ebro station/Spain in the vicinity of the eclipse path reveal the origin of the wave activity in the lower thermosphere below about 180 km altitude, the similar observations at Pruhonice/Czech Republic provide arguments to localize the origin of the abnormal waves in the middle atmosphere well below the ionospheric heights. Although ionosonde and HF Doppler measurements show enhanced wave activity, the TEC data analysis does not, which is an indication that the wave amplitudes are too small for detecting them via this interpolation method. The total ionization reduces up to about 30% during the event. A comparison with similar observations from the solar eclipse of 11 August 1999 revealed a quite different ionospheric behavior at different latitudes, a fact that needs further investigation.},

The temporal and spatial variation in plasma mass density was thus determined and compared with VLF whistler measurements of electron densities at similar times and locations. The plasma mass loading was estimated and found to be low, corresponding to 5\&\{\#\}8211;10% He+ on the days examined. The plasma mass density is described by a law of the form (R/R eq)\&\{\#\}8722;p , where p is in the range 3\&\{\#\}8211;6 but shows considerable temporal variation, for example, in response to changes in magnetic activity. Other features that were observed include diurnal trends such as the sunrise enhancement in plasma density at low latitudes, latitude-dependent substorm refilling effects, shelves in the plasma density versus L profile, and a longitudinal asymmetry in plasma density. We can also monitor motion of the plasmapause across the station array. Properties of the resonance were examined, including the resonance size, Q, and damping. Finally, we note the appearance of fine structure in power spectra at these latitudes, suggesting that magnetospheric waveguide or cavity modes may be important in selecting wave frequencies.},

Estimates of the speed and direction of the TID indicate that it was caused by an atmospheric gravity wave expanding from a localized source over the Arctic Ocean north of eastern Siberia. Auroral imaging shows that the source region was located near the westward edge of an expanding auroral bulge and may have been associated with a westward traveling surge (WTS). The largest TID amplitudes were observed along a line perpendicular to the orientation of the auroral oval, and TID periods increased with distance from the source region. This set of observations provides one of the most complete cause and effect relationships found thus far in the study of atmospheric gravity waves.},

In the ensuing decades new observations, including radar and low-altitude spacecraft, MHD simulations, and theoretical considerations have tremendously advanced our understanding of this system. The AMPTE/IRM, THEMIS and Cluster missions have added considerable observational knowledge, especially on the important role of fast flows in producing the stresses that generate the substorm current wedge. Recent detailed, multi-spacecraft, multi-instrument observations both in the magnetosphere and in the ionosphere have brought a wealth of new information about the details of the temporal evolution and structure of the current system. While the large-scale picture remains valid, the new details call for revision and an update of the original view. In this paper we briefly review the historical development of the substorm current wedge, review recent in situ and ground-based observations and theoretical work, and discuss the current active research areas. We conclude with a revised, time-dependent picture of the substorm current wedge that follows its evolution from the initial substorm flows through substorm expansion and recovery.},

Some events were so bright that the weaker 557.7 nm thermospheric line was readily visible and produced sharper images because of the shorter excitation lifetime. Global Positioning System observations show that the airglow features are traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). The remarkable feature of the data is the overwhelming tendency for these low-velocity TIDs to develop with a northwest to southeast orientation and to propagate in the southwest direction. Speeds ranged from 50 to 170 m/s, and wavelengths ranged from 50 to 500 km. The Perkins instability is investigated as a possible explanation for the structures. The linear theory, including both winds and electric fields, predicts a positive but small growth rate. However, the real part of the dispersion relation gives the wrong sign for the wave propagation. Furthermore, the growth rate seems too small to amplify a seed gravity wave significantly during one period of neutral gas oscillation. We conclude that this class of low-velocity TID is not yet explained theoretically.},

To examine the atmospheric and ionospheric behavior during this event, three main parameters are used (1) Total Electron Content (TEC) collected from the International Global Positioning System and from the Brazilian Network of Continuous Monitoring stations, (2) daytime E × B vertical drift derived from the magnetometers located at the equatorial station Alta Floresta (9.9$\,^\{\circ\}$S, 55.9$\,^\{\circ\}$W, dip latitude 1.96$\,^\{\circ\}$) and an off-equatorial station Cuiaba (15.3$\,^\{\circ\}$S, 56.0$\,^\{\circ\}$W, dip latitude 7.10$\,^\{\circ\}$), both in the Brazilian sector, (3) the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) meridional and zonal wind components measured by the Meteor Radar located at the southern midlatitude Santa Maria (29.4$\,^\{\circ\}$S, 53.3$\,^\{\circ\}$W, dip latitude 17.8$\,^\{\circ\}$). We identify the anomalous variation in E × B drift based on later local-time migration of peak value with SSW days. A novel feature of the present study is the identification of the similar migration pattern in the TEC anomaly, in spite that the simultaneous solar flux increases during the SSW event. Other novel features are the amplification of the 13--16 day period in the TEC anomaly during the SSW days and simultaneous amplification of this period in the meridional and zonal wind components in the MLT region, as far as 30$\,^\{\circ\}$S. These aspects reveal the presence of coupled atmosphere-ionosphere dynamics during the SSW event and the amplification of the lunar and/or solar tidal component, a characteristic which is recently reported from the electrojet current measurements.},

  abstract    = {<p><span style="font-family:open sans,arial,helvetica neue,helvetica,tahoma,optima,sans-serif; font-size:14px">On August 21, 2017, there will be a total solar eclipse over the United States traveling from Oregon to South Carolina. Solar eclipses offer a way to study the dependence of the ionospheric density and morphology on incident solar radiation. There are significant differences between the conditions during a solar eclipse and the conditions normally experienced at sunset and sunrise, including the east-west motion of the eclipse terminator, the speed of the transition, and the continued visibility of the corona throughout the eclipse interval. Taken together, these factors imply that unique ionospheric responses may be witnessed during eclipses. These include changes in the ionospheric electric fields, changes in the Total Electron Content (TEC) along paths through the eclipsed region, and variations in the density and altitude of the F2 peak. Several studies over the past century investigated these effects; however, some of the results from these studies are contradictory. These contradictions and the studies\{\textquoteright\} limited spatial resolution leave many fundamental questions unanswered. The advent of several mid-latitude Global Positioning System (GPS) and radar networks in the past few decades, such as the Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) system and the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radar system, have enabled ionospheric observations with hitherto unprecedented spatial resolution. Also, the establishment of several nationwide amateur radio reporting systems, such as the Reverse Beacon Network (RBN) that monitors radio wave propagation on the high frequency (HF) bands, offers the potential for evaluating changes in ionospheric conditions with unprecedented spatial resolution. We propose to study the effects of the total solar eclipse on the ionosphere using a combination of GPS receivers, the SuperDARN radar system, HF band amateur radio, and plasma modeling. The overall objectives of this study are to characterize the changes in F-region plasma morphology during the eclipse over a larger spatial domain than any previous eclipse experiment. In addition, the amateur radio component of our study offers a unique opportunity to further engage the amateur radio community nationwide in a scientific study.</span></p>},

  abstract = {It has been known for at least 30 years that vertically narrow thermal layers form within the middle atmosphere. Two types of temperature enhancements, the low-latitude to midlatitude mesosphere inversion layer (MIL) and the high-latitude winter stratosphere temperature enhancement (STE), have both received much attention within the atmospheric science community because of their unexplained formation mechanisms and potential impacts on the middle-atmosphere global circulation. Numerous experimental, numerical, and theoretical studies have attempted to explain certain aspects of these respective thermal layers, but no one theory consistently and satisfactorily describes all the features observed. We present a review of the literature and explicitly propose a classification scheme based on the different formation mechanisms suspected to cause these events. For the MIL we demonstrate that there are two subtypes. The first one is tidally driven and tends to occur above ∼85 km. This MIL originates from large-amplitude tidal waves propagating into the mesosphere and their subsequent nonlinear interactions with gravity waves, which can often create the appearance of a ``double MIL'' separated by approximately one vertical tidal wavelength (∼25 km). The other subtype of MIL is formed by a climatological planetary wave dissipation mechanism that occurs at a zero-wind line. The dissipation of the planetary wave tends to generate a mesoscale (∼1000 km) inversion layer in the range of 65--80 km. These two formation mechanisms explain a host of observed characteristics, including the reason behind the downward progression of some MILs and not others, the different climatological nature of the two forms of MIL events, and the relative scarcity of MIL observations at high latitudes. The STE is believed to be generated by an altogether different process, namely, the nonlinear interaction between the polar vortex and planetary waves/Aleutian High. The induced temperatures typically peak around 40 km and often exceed 300 K, generating what appears to be a ``low, hot stratopause.'' When vertical temperature profiles are combined with synoptic analyses, one observes that the STE is the consequence of high-latitude vortex interactions creating a baroclinic atmosphere, i.e., a downward adiabatic compression induced by an ageostropic flow. We summarize the details of the relationship between this feature and sudden stratospheric warmings, as well as the potential for in situ gravity wave generation. We close with a review of currently unexplained MIL/STE features and offer new directions for future middle-atmosphere thermal layer research.},

The new model and the associated NRLMSIS database now include the following data: (1) total mass density from satellite accelerometers and from orbit determination (including the Jacchia and Barlier data sets), (2) temperature from incoherent scatter radar covering 1981--1997, and (3) molecular oxygen number density, [O2], from solar ultraviolet occultation aboard the Solar Maximum Mission. A new component, ``anomalous oxygen,'' allows for appreciable O+ and hot atomic oxygen contributions to the total mass density at high altitudes and applies primarily to drag estimation above 500 km. Extensive tables compare our entire database to the NRLMSISE-00, MSISE-90, and Jacchia-70 models for different altitude bands and levels of geomagnetic activity. We also explore scientific issues related to the new data sets in the NRLMSIS database. Especially noteworthy is the solar activity dependence of the Jacchia data, with which we study a large O+ contribution to the total mass density under the combination of summer, low solar activity, high latitude, and high altitude. Under these conditions, except at very low solar activity, the Jacchia data and the Jacchia-70 model indeed show a significantly higher total mass density than does MSISE-90. However, under the corresponding winter conditions, the MSIS-class models represent a noticeable improvement relative to Jacchia-70 over a wide range of F10.7. Considering the two regimes together, NRLMSISE-00 achieves an improvement over both MSISE-90 and Jacchia-70 by incorporating advantages of each.},

   abstract = {Recent observations of particle distributions that are narrow in pitch angle and broad in energy have suggested that kinetic AlfvÈn waves are a significant contributor to auroral particle acceleration. Oscillations at frequencies near 1 Hz are a natural consequence of the propagation of AlfvÈn waves in the strongly varying AlfvÈn speed profile above the auroral ionosphere, the so-called ionospheric AlfvÈn resonator. These waves often propagate in the presence of perpendicular density gradients at various spatial scales. Simulations have been performed to study the evolution of these fields including both parallel and perpendicular inhomogeneity. Phase mixing at the boundaries of the density cavity leads to small-scale AlfvÈn waves, which can develop the parallel electric fields needed to accelerate the AlfvÈnic aurora. These simulations verify the kinetic AlfvÈn wave dispersion relation in the electron inertial limit, which predicts that the perpendicular phase and group velocity of these waves are in the opposite direction. In addition, the results show that narrow spatial scales are favored by high ionospheric conductance.},

   abstract = {A short-lived auroral spiral is observed on February 3, 1999, around 2204 UT, using the Multi-Instrument Array for Ionosphere-Magnetosphere Coupling Studies (MIRACLE) network of ground-based instruments in Fennoscandia, which consists of magnetometers, coherent scatter radars, and all-sky cameras. Four minutes later, after this spiral has subsided, the auroral bulge of a fully developed substorm that has set on earlier over Russia intrudes into the MIRACLE field of view from the east. Hence the auroral spiral precedes the substorm spatially (i.e., it is located westward of the substorm bulge) rather than temporarily. Since this spiral is associated with a localized and short-lived substorm-type auroral development, we interpret it as a \&\{\#\}8220;pseudobreakup spiral,\&\{\#\}8221; which is subsequently covered by the intruding auroral bulge, during the decaying phase of the pseudobreakup activity. In contrast to growth phase pseudobreakups that occur temporally before a full breakup, this pseudobreakup is observed spatially ahead (westward) of an already evolving substorm bulge. Our instantaneous spatial analysis of the distributions of ionospheric electrodynamic parameters associated with this spiral shows that all key features are similar to the ionospheric electrodynamics of the westward traveling surge: sharp decrease of conductance toward the west, from Hall conductance values up to 30 S in the spiral to less than 2 S west of it, a cluster of upward field-aligned currents (FACs) in the spiral area with magnitudes up to 5 A km\&\{\#\}8722;2, and anticlockwise spiraling horizontal currents around it. The upward FACs, diverging at least 100 kA of current in total, are fed to a large extent by a \&\{\#\}8220;pseudosubstorm electrojet\&\{\#\}8221; carried by westward flowing Hall currents. No signs of local current closure by downward FACs from the immediate vicinity of the spiral are found. Our results are inconsistent with the earlier conjecture that insufficient ionospheric conductance would prevent the pseudobreakup to evolve to a full breakup. Since the solar wind data do not provide clear evidence for being a driver of the pseudobreakup-breakup sequence, the driver has to be an internal magnetospheric one.},

High school teachers and a few middle school teachers at these and/or neighboring schools took part in a long-term professional development program based around space science and the magnetometer data. The teachers created week-long to semester-long projects during which their students worked on THEMIS lessons that they, their colleagues, and the E/PO team created. In addition to this program, THEMIS E/PO also launched the only Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS) Great Explorations in Mathematics and Science (GEMS) site in Nevada. This site provides a sustainable place for teacher professional development using hands-on GEMS activities, and has been used by teachers around the state of Nevada. Short-term professional development for K-12 teachers (one-hour to two-day workshops), with a focus on the Tribal College and Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) communities have reached hundreds of teachers across the country. A&nbsp;Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) ViewSpace show on auroras and THEMIS was created and distributed, and shown in over a hundred science centers and museums nationwide.

@article{Nose2010,
   abstract = {There are two schools of thought regarding the excitation mechanism of low-latitude Pi2 pulsations. One is the cavity mode resonance, which is established by fast mode waves that are emitted at substorm onset and form the standing oscillation within the plasmasphere. The other is the bursty bulk flow (BBF)-driven process, in which periodical BBFs traveling from the magnetotail cause pressure pulses in the inner magnetosphere, generating Pi2 pulsations. This study intends to examine which of these two excitation mechanisms is more plausible. A working assumption is that in the case of the cavity mode resonance the wave period of Pi2 pulsations depends on the size and the plasma mass density of the plasmasphere, while in the case of the BBF-driven process the wave period is controlled by the BBF period and is independent of the plasmaspheric parameters. We investigated long-term variation in wave period of Pi2 pulsations observed at the Kakioka observatory for the period from March 1983 to October 2009. Multiple correlation analysis revealed that the Pi2 period is negatively correlated with the \&\{\#\}931;Kp index and positively correlated with ion mass in the near-Earth plasma sheet or the F10.7 index. The \&\{\#\}931;Kp index is considered as a proxy for the size of the plasmasphere, and the plasma sheet ion mass or the F10.7 index can be considered as a proxy for the mass density of the plasmasphere, indicating that the Pi2 period is proportional to both the size and mass density of the plasmasphere. This result strongly supports the plasmaspheric cavity mode resonance as an excitation mechanism of low-latitude Pi2 pulsations.},

  abstract = {©2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. We evaluate the performance of three methods for determining the ground range and refractive index of ionospheric scattering volumes. Each method uses the same equivalent path analysis with the latter parameter derived through the additional use of Snell's law. Two of these methods make their predictions using the group range and a virtual height model for each scattering volume; the third method uses the group range and the elevation angle of the ray. The effectiveness of each of these methods is evaluated using ray tracing through a simulated reference ionosphere. Ray tracings provide determinations of the initial elevation angle and group range of the transmitted signal and the ground range and refractive index of the scattering volume. The first pair of parameters is used as inputs to the geolocation methods, and the second pair becomes part of a data set against which the predictions of the geolocation methods are evaluated. We find that the geolocation methods using virtual height models change the initial elevation angle to a value that is consistent with their virtual height model but inconsistent with ray tracing. Consequently, predictions of ground range and refractive index from methods using virtual height models are rarely consistent with predictions from ray tracing. In contrast, the third method uses the initial elevation angle from ray tracing and yields accurate predictions in the bottomside ionosphere. Two modifications were made to this method to extend the agreement between it and ray tracing to all backscattered signals.},

In this work, empirical relationships based on indices (AE, IL, and KP), an empirical model (Weimer-2005), coupled space weather models (BATS-R-US+CRCM/RCM), and combinative methods (using data from SuperDARN for electric field and OVATION PRIME+IRI combination for the conductances) are employed to investigate the Joule heating (JH) variability during two isolated substorms on 8 March 2008. The results are compared according to substorm phases, magnetic local time sectors, magnetic latitudes, role of electric fields, ionospheric conductances, and neutral wind. Qualitatively, all methods exhibit similar variations in the estimated JH rates. AE-dependent methods and the Weimer-2005 model show the highest JH rates. The response of AE to the elevated Epsilon levels is found to be delayed up to 50 min, whereas the onsets and variations in the other methods are concurrent with Epsilon. The combination of OVATION Prime+IRI and SuperDARN provides values close to the (Foster et al., 1983, https://doi.org/10.1029/JA088iA06p04885) suggesting that it is representative enough to use for estimating the JH. The OVATION Prime+IRI and SuperDARN method can provide JH at any point in the solar cycle based on dynamic solar wind input. BATSRUS/CRCM conductances and electric fields are higher than BATSRUS/RCM leading to 2.5 times as much JH as estimated by BATSRUS/RCM on average. Neutral winds are found to comprise an overall 15% of total JH with a maximum of 25% in dusk sector during the expansion phase. We discuss that W05 and AE-dependent methods overestimate the JH rates during the solar minimum since they are constructed using solar maximum data.},

  abstract = {©2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. We present simultaneous space and ground-based observations of Pi2 pulsations which occurred during a substorm on 25 September 2014. The timeline for this event starts at ∼06:04 UT when the THEMIS probe D located inside the plasmasphere detected Pi2 pulsations in the electric and magnetic fields. Cross-spectral analysis shows the azimuthal electric field and compressional magnetic field oscillated nearly in quadrature, highly suggestive of a standing fast-mode wave. Simultaneous Pi2 observations from dayside and nightside ground magnetometers at low latitudes indicate a global wave mode. A latitudinal magnetometer chain on the nightside observed a phase reversal in the H component of the Pi2 pulsations when crossing the footprint of the plasmapause, estimated from THEMIS spacecraft measurements. Spectral analysis of data from ground magnetometers in this latitudinal chain showed fundamental and second harmonic spectral peaks in their H and D components. Similar pulsation signatures at comparable harmonic frequencies were observed by three midlatitude SuperDARN HF radars, both poleward and equatorward of the plasmapause ionospheric footprint. Finally, the longitudinal polarization pattern and azimuthal phase propagation of midlatitude Pi2 pulsations are consistent with previous observations of a plasmaspheric virtual resonance being excited by a longitudinally localized source near midnight.},

  abstract = {©2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Ionospheric scintillation is caused by irregularities in the ionospheric electron density. The characterization of ionospheric irregularities is important to further our understanding of the underlying physics. Our goal is to characterize the intermediate (0.1–10 km) to medium (10–100 km) scale high-latitude irregularities which are likely to produce these scintillations. In this paper, we characterize irregularities observed by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) during a geomagnetically active period on 9 March 2012. For this purpose, along with the measurements, we are using the recently developed model: “Satellite-beacon Ionospheric-scintillation Global Model of the upper Atmosphere” (SIGMA). The model is particularly applicable at high latitudes as it accounts for the complicated geometry of the magnetic field lines in these regions and is presented in an earlier paper. We use an inverse modeling technique to derive irregularity parameters by comparing the high rate (50 Hz) GNSS observations to the modeled outputs. In this investigation, we consider experimental observations from both the northern and southern high latitudes. The results include predominance of phase scintillations compared to amplitude scintillations that imply the presence of larger-scale irregularities of sizes above the Fresnel scale at GPS frequencies, and the spectral index ranges from 2.4 to 4.2 and the RMS number density ranges from 3e11 to 2.3e12 el/m3. The best fits we obtained from our inverse method that considers only weak scattering mostly agree with the observations. Finally, we suggest some improvements in order to facilitate the possibility of accomplishing a unique solution to such inverse problems.},

   abstract = {A glowing ribbon of purple light running east-west in the night sky has recently been observed by citizen scientists. This narrow, subauroral, visible structure, distinct from the traditional auroral oval, was largely undocumented in the scientific literature and little was known about its formation. Amateur photo sequences showed colors distinctly different from common types of aurora and occasionally indicated magnetic field–aligned substructures. Observations from the Swarm satellite as it crossed the arc have revealed an unusual level of electron temperature enhancement and density depletion, along with a strong westward ion flow, indicating that a pronounced subauroral ion drift (SAID) is associated with this structure. These early results suggest the arc is an optical manifestation of SAID, presenting new opportunities for investigation of the dynamic SAID signatures from the ground. On the basis of the measured ion properties and original citizen science name, we propose to identify this arc as a Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement (STEVE).},

Observational data come from the THEMIS Substorm Database, assembled under the auspices of the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) program (http://www.igpp.ucla.edu/themis/events/). We find that Φstarts to increase a few minutes prior to ground midlatitude Pi2 onset. Although our study cannot monitor regions beyond 30 RE, the apogee of the most distant probe (P1), enhanced transport tends to begin at 20--30 RE and moves progressively inward just prior to ground Pi2 onset. Our results are consistent with recent THEMIS case studies showing that reconnection initiates the substorm expansion phase process.},

The high-latitude thermospheric wind simulated with SDP showed very good agreement with the Fabry-Perot interferometer thermospheric wind data inside the polar cap at Resolute, Canada (74.7$\,^\{\circ\}$N, 94.8$\,^\{\circ\}$W, magnetic latitude 84). The Heelis model overestimated the winds during the storm event, because the model does not consider the cross polar cap potential saturation at high global geomagnetic index (Kp) values. The Weimer model provides a better performance than the Heelis model in this case. However, it has a larger discrepancy compared to the SDP results. The SDP provides an alternative data-based tool for study of the ionosphere/thermosphere interactions in the polar cap.},

Two principal components are identified: the first mode (PC1) is related to ``uniform variation''of the flow speed at all MLTs, and is primarily governed by IMF Bz. The second mode (PC2) is related to ``dawn-dusk asymmetry'', and is predominantly driven by IMF By. PCA gives the relative variance contribution of the two modes: PC1 giving ∼42% of the total variance and PC2 ∼17% of the total variance, which is about 40% of that from PC1. Due to the orthogonality of the principal components, the degree of dawn-dusk asymmetry can be represented byP2, where P2 is a component value when the observed data are projected along PC2. We identified P2 as proportional to IMF By, which leads to stronger dawn flows for By > 0 and stronger dusk flows for By < 0. The same primary modes are found regardless of the IMF orientation, implying that they are intrinsic properties of the average polar cap convection.},

(1970). Generally good agreement between observation and theory is found. The role of the dawn-dusk electric field responsible for magnetospheric convection is examined in some detail and is treated in the circuit analogy as the field due to an external generator connected across the circuit. It is found that the erosion process requires two distinct time constants for a proper description: (1) the time needed for magnetosheath plasma to travel down the freshly reconnected field lines to the ionosphere and (2) roughly, the time required for the foot of a reconnected field line to travel one quarter of the total noon-midnight dimension of the polar cap. The second time constant is the dominant one and is not related to the ionospheric conductivity, as has been suggested previously. Examination of high-latitude magnetograms obtained during the erosion event discussed shows that the electric field oscillations predicted by the theory and observed by the spacecraft in terms of oscillations in the magnetopause position are also reflected in oscillations in ionospheric current flow.},

MSTIDs were observed primarily from fall through spring. Two populations were observed: a dominant population heading southeast (centered at 147$\,^\{\circ\}$ geographic azimuth, ranging from 100$\,^\{\circ\}$ to 210$\,^\{\circ\}$) and a secondary population heading northwest (centered at −50$\,^\{\circ\}$ azimuth, ranging from −75$\,^\{\circ\}$ to −25$\,^\{\circ\}$). Horizontal velocities ranged from 50 to 250 m s−1 with a distribution maximum between 100 and 150 m s−1. Horizontal wavelengths ranged from 100 to 500 km with a distribution peak at 250 km, and periods between 23 and 60 min, suggesting that the MSTIDs may be consistent with thermospheric gravity waves. A local time (LT) dependence was observed such that the dominant (southeastward) population decreased in number as the day progressed until a late afternoon increase. The secondary (northwestward) population appeared only in the afternoon, possibly indicative of neutral wind effects or variability of sources. LT dependence was not observed in other parameters. Possible solar-geomagnetic and tropospheric MSTID sources were considered. The auroral electrojet (AE) index showed a correlation with MSTID statistics. Reverse ray tracing with the HINDGRATS model indicates that the dominant population has source regions over the Great Lakes and near the geomagnetic cusp, while the secondary population source region is 100 km above the Atlantic Ocean east of the Carolinas. This suggests that the dominant population may come from a region favorable to either tropospheric or geomagnetic sources, while the secondary population originates from a region favorable to secondary waves generated via lower atmospheric convection.},

  abstract = {Ion drag is known to play an important role in driving neutral thermosphere circulation at auroral latitudes, especially during the main phase of geomagnetic storms. During the recovery phase, the neutrals are known to drive the ions and generate ionospheric electric fields and currents via the disturbance dynamo mechanism. At midlatitudes, the precise interplay between ions and neutrals is less understood largely because of the paucity of measurements that have been available. In this work, we investigate ion-neutral coupling at middle latitudes using colocated ion drift velocity measurements obtained from Super Dual Auroral Radar Network radars and neutral wind velocity and temperature measurements obtained from the North American Thermosphere Ionosphere Observing Network (NATION) Fabry-Perot interferometers. We examine one recent storm period on 2--3 October 2013 during both the main phase and late recovery phase. By using ion-neutral momentum exchange theory and a time-lagged correlation analysis, we analyze the coupling time scales and dominant driving mechanisms. We observe that during the main phase the neutrals respond to the ion convection on a time scale of ∼84 min which is significantly faster than what would be expected from local ion drag momentum forcing alone. This suggests that other storm time influences are important for driving the neutrals during the main phase, such as Joule heating. During the late recovery phase, the neutrals are observed to drive the ion convection without any significant time delay, consistent with the so-called ``neutral fly wheel effect''or disturbance dynamo persisting well into the late recovery phase.},

   abstract = {Amateur radio reporting networks, such as the Reverse Beacon Network (RBN), PSKReporter, and the Weak Signal Propagation Network, are powerful tools for remote sensing the ionosphere. These voluntarily constructed and operated networks provide real-time and archival data that could be used for space weather operations, forecasting, and research. The potential exists for the study of both global and localized effects. The capability of one such network to detect space weather disturbances is demonstrated by examining the impacts on RBN-observed HF propagation paths of an X2.9 class solar flare detected by the GOES 15 satellite. Prior to the solar flare, the RBN observed strong HF propagation conditions between multiple continents, primarily Europe, North America, and South America. Immediately following the GOES 15 detection of the solar flare, the number of reported global RBN propagation paths dropped to less than 35% that of prior observations. After the flare, the RBN showed the gradual recovery of HF propagation conditions.},

On 22 February 2008, the Blackstone SuperDARN radar and THEMIS ground magnetometers simultaneously observed substorm Pi2 pulsations. Similarities in measurements from the Blackstone radar and a magnetometer at Remus suggest a common generating mechanism. Cross-phase analysis of magnetometer data places these measurements at the ionospheric projection of the plasmapause, while fine spatial and temporal details of the radar data show evidence of field line compressions. About 1 min prior to ground Pi2 observation, 2 Earthward-moving Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs) were observed by THEMIS probes D and E in the near-Earth plasma sheet. We conclude that the first 2 pulses of the Pi2s observed at Blackstone and Remus result from compressional energy generated by BBFs braking against the magnetospheric dipolar region.},

We have aurally decoded the Morse coded call signs of 14 hams (amateur operators) from RRI's data to help ascertain their locations during the experiment. Through careful analysis of the hams' transmissions, and with the aid of ray tracing tools, we have identified two notable magnetoionic effects in the received signals: plasma cutoff and single-mode fading. The signature of the former effect appeared approximately 30 s into the experiment, with the sudden cessation of signals received by RRI despite measurements from a network of ground-based receivers showing that the hams' transmissions were unabated throughout the experiment. The latter effect, single-mode fading, was detected as a double-peak modulation on the individual dots and dashes of one of the ham's Morse coded transmissions. We show that the modulation in the ham's signal agrees with expected fading rate for single-mode fading. The results of this experiment demonstrate that ham radio transmissions are a valuable tool for studying radio wave propagation and remotely sensing the ionosphere. The analysis and results provide a basis for future collaborations in radio science between traditional researchers in the academia and industry, and citizen scientists in which novel and compelling experiments can be performed.},

These were detected as changes in medium- and high-frequency radio propagation by the Solar Eclipse QSO Party citizen science experiment organized by the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (hamsci.org). This is the first eclipse-ionospheric study to make use of measurements from a citizen-operated, global-scale HF propagation network and develop tools for comparison to a physics-based model ionosphere. Eclipse effects were observed ±0.3 hr on 1.8 MHz, ±0.75 hr on 3.5 and 7 MHz, and ±1 hr on 14 MHz and are consistent with eclipse-induced ionospheric densities. Observations were simulated using the PHaRLAP raytracing toolkit in conjunction with the eclipsed SAMI3 ionospheric model. Model results suggest 1.8, 3.5, and 7 MHz refracted at h≥125 km altitude with elevation angles θ≥22°, while 14 MHz signals refracted at h < 125 km with elevation angles θ < 10°.},

  abstract  = {©2019. The Authors. Numerous solar flares and coronal mass ejection-induced interplanetary shocks associated with solar active region AR12673 caused disturbances to terrestrial high-frequency (HF, 3–30 MHz) radio communications from 4–14 September 2017. Simultaneously, Hurricanes Irma and Jose caused significant damage to the Caribbean Islands and parts of Florida. The coincidental timing of both the space weather activity and hurricanes was unfortunate, as HF radio was needed for emergency communications. This paper presents the response of HF amateur radio propagation as observed by the Reverse Beacon Network and the Weak Signal Propagation Reporting Network to the space weather events of that period. Distributed data coverage from these dense sources provided a unique mix of global and regional coverage of ionospheric response and recovery that revealed several features of storm time HF propagation dynamics. X-class flares on 6, 7, and 10 September caused acute radio blackouts during the day in the Caribbean with recovery times of tens of minutes to hours, based on the decay time of the flare. A severe geomagnetic storm with Kpmax = 8+ and SYM-Hmin = −146 nT occurring 7–10 September wiped out ionospheric communications first on 14 MHz and then on 7 MHz starting at ∼1200 UT 8 September. This storm, combined with affects from additional flare and geomagnetic activity, contributed to a significant suppression of effective HF propagation bands both globally and in the Caribbean for a period of 12 to 15 days.},

The novel measurement principle enables the fabrication of a low-cost sensor with low power consumption and with measuring capabilities that are comparable to recent developments for CubeSat applications. The current magnetometer, a software-modified version of a commercial sensor, is capable of detecting fields with amplitudes as low as 8.7 nT at 40 Hz and 2.7 nT at 1 Hz, with a noise floor of 4 pT∕Hz at 1 Hz. The sensor has a linear response to less than 3 % over a range of ±100 000 nT. All of these features make the magneto-inductive principle a promising technology for the development of magnetic sensors for both space-borne and ground-based applications to study geomagnetic activity.},

   abstract = {© 2017 IEEE. The biological inner ear, or cochlea, is a sophisticated signal processing system that performs spectrum analysis over an ultra-broadband frequency range of ∼20 Hz to 20 kHz with exquisite sensitivity and high energy efficiency. Electronic cochlear models, which mimic the exponentially-tapered structure of the biological inner ear using transmission lines or filter cascades, have been shown to be fast and extremely efficient spectrum analyzers at both audio and radio frequencies. We have previously used this model to create single-chip RF spectrum analyzers, and have recently developed improved output encoding methods for such cochlea-like analyzers. A prototype analyzer has been designed in the UMC 65 nm RF-CMOS process. It includes a bidirectional cochlea model with 50 parallel exponentially-spaced output stages and analyzes the radio spectrum from 0.8-8.3 GHz. The outputs are encoded as delta-sigma (ΔΣ) modulated digital signals that are demodulated and analyzed in real-time by a digital back-end implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The resulting system is expected to be useful as a broadband spectrum sensor in cognitive radio networks.},

Decreasing static power consumption of the WUR is critical for increasing the operational lifetime of the node. Several techniques are introduced to minimize power consumption while maintaining sensitivity, including step-up impedance transformation, an ultra-low-power RF amplifier, and digital offset adjustment. RF energy harvesting using a rectifier is also proposed to increase node lifetime. The receiver is designed and simulated using UMC 65 nm CMOS and has a power consumption of 11.5 nW. It successfully demodulates 1 kbps on-off-keyed data from a -60 dBm carrier at 50 MHz with an impedance of 1.8 kΩ across the input terminals of the RF receiver. This work surpasses state-of-the-art WURs in terms of sensitivity-power trade-off.},

Electronic cochlear models, which mimic the exponentially-tapered structure of the biological inner ear using transmission lines or filter cascades, have been shown to be fast and extremely efficient spectrum analyzers at both audio and radio frequencies (RF). Here we present improved output encoding methods for such cochlea-like analyzers. We have developed neuron-like asynchronous event-generation circuits to efficiently encode cochlear outputs, including ring-oscillator-based injection-locked frequency dividers (ILFDs) that accurately encode input frequencies and phase-sensitive detectors that encode both amplitude and phase information and thereby improve frequency resolution without reducing temporal resolution.},

   abstract = {© 2017 IEEE. A novel delta-sigma (Δ - Σ) modulation method is proposed for extending noise-shaping to two dimensions: space and time. The goal is to improve the noise figure (NF) and linearity of low noise amplifiers (LNAs) for use in microwave and mm-wave antenna arrays. We show that a spatially-oversampled antenna array coupled to an N-port noise-shaped LNA can diminish in-band additive noise and distortion by shaping the multi-dimensional spectrum of these unwanted components towards higher spatial frequencies that are outside the space-time region of support (ROS) of all possible propagating electromagnetic waves. The shaped noise is then removed by spatial filtering with a linear beamformer. This paper analyzes the concept and presents simulation results for a 33, 65, and 129-port noise-shaped LNAs in 65nm CMOS operating at 4GHz.},

  abstract  = {The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) is a network of high-frequency (HF) radars located in the high- and mid-latitude regions of both hemispheres that is operated under international cooperation. The network was originally designed for monitoring the dynamics of the ionosphere and upper atmosphere in the high-latitude regions. However, over the last approximately 15 years, SuperDARN has expanded into the mid-latitude regions. With radar coverage that now extends continuously from auroral to sub-auroral and mid-latitudes, a wide variety of new scientific findings have been obtained. In this paper, the background of mid-latitude SuperDARN is presented at first. Then, the accomplishments made with mid-latitude SuperDARN radars are reviewed in five specified scientific and technical areas: convection, ionospheric irregularities, HF propagation analysis, ion-neutral interactions, and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Finally, the present status of mid-latitude SuperDARN is updated and directions for future research are discussed.},

@article{Lin2015,
   abstract = {Abstract. Ionospheric data assimilation is a powerful approach to reconstruct the 3-D distribution of the ionospheric electron density from various types of observations. We present a data assimilation model for the ionosphere, based on the Gauss–Markov Kalman filter with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) as the background model, to assimilate two different types of slant total electron content (TEC) observations from ground-based GPS and space-based FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (F3/C) radio occultation. Covariance models for the background model error and observational error play important roles in data assimilation. The objective of this study is to investigate impacts of stationary (location-independent) and non-stationary (location-dependent) classes of the background model error covariance on the quality of assimilation analyses. Location-dependent correlations are modeled using empirical orthogonal functions computed from an ensemble of the IRI outputs, while location-independent correlations are modeled using a Gaussian function. Observing system simulation experiments suggest that assimilation of slant TEC data facilitated by the location-dependent background model error covariance yields considerably higher quality assimilation analyses. Results from assimilation of real ground-based GPS and F3/C radio occultation observations over the continental United States are presented as TEC and electron density profiles. Validation with the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar data and comparison with the Abel inversion results are also presented. Our new ionospheric data assimilation model that employs the location-dependent background model error covariance outperforms the earlier assimilation model with the location-independent background model error covariance, and can reconstruct the 3-D ionospheric electron density distribution satisfactorily from both ground- and space-based GPS observations.},

  abstract  = {Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) missions, such as the Formosa Satellite‐3/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (FORMOSAT‐3/COSMIC) and the upcoming FORMOSAT‐7/COSMIC‐2, provide valuable profiling of the ionized atmosphere for the monitoring of space weather. This study shows that the FORMOSAT‐3/COSMIC and FORMOSAT‐7/COSMIC‐2 missions' ability to monitor highly variable ionospheric weather can be considerably extended with the help of data assimilation. The Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) Ionosphere is a new data assimilation system designed specifically for the low‐latitude and midlatitude ionosphere. The capability of the GSI Ionosphere is first demonstrated with actual FORMOSAT‐3/COSMIC RO total electron content (TEC) data for January 2013. Features of the ionospheric equatorial ionization anomaly in a coupled plasmasphere ionosphere thermosphere model become more consistent with the TEC maps created with independent ground‐based GPS data. The consistency has improved by assimilation of FORMOSAT‐3/COSMIC RO data up to about 50% in comparison to the control simulation case without data assimilation. To evaluate the impact of future RO missions on ionospheric weather specification, comparative Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) are carried out with synthetic RO TEC data. An OSSE of FORMOSAT‐7/COSMIC‐2 shows that the GSI Ionosphere can improve the ionospheric specification within ±30° geomagnetic latitude by 67% over the control case, which is comparable to the improvement yielded by FORMOSAT‐3/COSMIC for 2009 (61%). These results indicate a great potential for improving the monitoring of realistic ionospheric weather with the help of FORMOSAT‐7/COSMIC‐2 RO TEC data. Data assimilation experiments with RO TEC from FORMOSAT‐3/COSMIC and FORMOST‐7/COSMIC‐2 observing systems are presented The capability of the GSI Ionosphere data assimilation system to reproduce realistic ionospheric features is demonstrated The potential of RO TEC data from the upcoming FORMOSAT‐7/COSMIC‐2 to improve ionospheric weather specification is evaluated},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACTPhysical processes that manifest as tangential vector fields on a sphere are common in geophysical and environmental sciences. These naturally occurring vector fields are often subject to physical constraints, such as being curl-free or divergence-free. We start with constructing parametric models for curl-free and divergence-free vector fields that are tangential to the unit sphere through applying the surface gradient or the surface curl operator to a scalar random potential field on the unit sphere. Using the Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition, we then construct a class of simple but flexible parametric models for general tangential vector fields, which are represented as a sum of a curl-free and a divergence-free components. We propose a likelihood-based parameter estimation procedure, and show that fast computation is possible even for large datasets when the observations are on a regular latitude–longitude grid. Characteristics and practical utility of the proposed methodology are illustrated thr...},

A large (~10x) enhancement in dayside TEC was observed over the US mainland during these events as Dst decreased sharply and strong SAPS electric fields eroded the outer reaches of the post-noon plasmasphere boundary layer (PBL) forming poleward-streaming plumes of storm enhanced density. TEC increased to >250 TECu equatorward of the PBL. TEC gradients across the PBL over the central US exceeded 60 TECu per deg latitude. While intense, these features are qualitatively similar to those seen in lesser storms.},

   abstract = {Using 2 years of coordinated CHAMP and DMSP observations we have investigated for the first time the relationship between subauroral polarization streams (SAPS), ionospheric Hall current (electrojet), upper thermospheric zonal wind, and mass density at subauroral regions in the dusk and premidnight sectors, separately for both hemispheres. For comparison, we have also analyzed the same parameters as a function of magnetic latitude (30°-80° magnetic latitude) during non-SAPS periods. During periods of non-SAPS, the neutral wind exhibits similar features as during SAPS events in the dusk to premidnight sector, streaming westward in the same direction as the plasma drift. Both neutral and plasma velocities peak at the same latitude regardless of SAPS occurrence. For higher geomagnetic activity both velocities are faster and the peaks shift equatorward. During non-SAPS periods, the ratio between plasma and neutral wind velocity is on average 2.75 ± 0.4 in both hemispheres irrespective of geomagnetic activity. The neutral wind during SAPS events gets enhanced by a factor of 1.5/1.2 for Kp <4 and 1.3/1.9 for Kp ≥ 4 in the Northern/Southern Hemisphere, respectively, as compared to non-SAPS time. The velocity difference between SAPS and neutral wind is also larger during SAPS period than during non-SAPS period, and the difference tends to increase with increasing geomagnetic activity. The peak latitude of the eastward auroral electrojet appears 1.5° poleward of the plasma drift during SAPS events, confirming the formation of SAPS equatorward of the high-conductivity channel. These SAPS-induced large winds can heat the upper thermosphere. As a result we observe a 10% enhanced mass density at 400 km altitude with respect to periods without SAPS. In addition a density anomaly peak occurs collocated with the SAPS, displaced from the electrojet peak. We regard this as an indication for efficient thermospheric heating by ion neutral friction.},

   abstract = {A prominent ionospheric longitudinal variation at midlatitudes, in particular, over the continental US, was found recently. This variation is characterized as a higher east-side electron density in the evening and a higher west-side electron density in the morning, and with clear seasonal and solar activity dependencies. A combined effect of geomagnetic declination and changing zonal winds was proposed to explain it. This paper represents a comprehensive investigation of this effect by examining climatology for both electron density longitudinal differences and the nighttime zonal winds in the eastern US. Electron density is from incoherent scatter radar extra-wide coverage experiments during 1978-2011 over Millstone Hill for which the spatial separation of the data can be up to 50° in longitude. The thermospheric zonal wind is from the on-site Fabry-Perot interferometer measurements during 1989-2001. The observed zonal wind climatology is found to be perfectly consistent with the expectation based on the east-west electron density differences in terms of local time, seasonal, and solar cycle dependencies. The correlation between the zonal wind and the east-west differential ratio is extremely high with an overall correlation coefficient of 0.93. The observed time delay of ˜3 hours in the response of electron density differences to zonal winds is a marked feature. Thus these results confirm positively the declination-zonal wind mechanism and provide new insight into longitudinal variations at midlatitudes for other geographic sectors.},

   abstract = {We examine Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar data collected over two solar cycles between 1979 and 2001 to determine average characteristics and features of storm time ion velocity and flux transport in the American sector midlatitude ionosphere. We use over 1100 radar azimuth scans identified as containing enhanced westward ion velocities associated with the subauroral polarization stream (SAPS), covering the 12-06 magnetic local time (MLT) sector and 50°-68° invariant latitude for weak to moderate disturbance levels with Dst from 50 to -200 nT. We find the magnetic latitude peak location of the SAPS flow channels decreases linearly with both Dst and MLT with a very good degree of correlation. We also examine for the first time SAPS peak westward ion fluxes, which transport material westward with magnitude between 3 × 1013 and 3 × 1014 m-2 s-1 in a manner nearly invariant to activity level. This invariance is maintained by an inverse relationship between electron density and ion velocity magnitudes with increasing Dst. Westward log ion flux and ion velocity are maximum in the dusk sector and decrease linearly with increasing MLT, smoothly varying across the dusk terminator. Finally, velocity distributions show that material in the afternoon SAPS flow is swept westward to earlier MLT values, delivering O+ flux to the cusp region. In contrast, SAPS streams in the post terminator sectors are fixed east-west in the Sun-Earth inertial frame, effectively maintaining entrained ion fluxes at the same MLT.},

Radar azimuth scans provide a regular database of ionospheric plasma convection observations spanning auroral and subauroral latitudes, and these scans have been examined for all local times and activity conditions.We examine the occurrence and characteristics of a persistent secondary westward convection peak which lies equatorward of the auroral two-cell convection. Individual scans and average patterns of plasma flow identify and characterize this latitudinally broad and persistent subauroral polarization stream (SAPS), which spans the nightside from dusk to the early morning sector for all Kp greater than 4. Premidnight, the SAPS westward convection lies equatorward of L = 4 (60° invariant latitude, $Λ$), spans 3°-5° of latitude, and has an average peak amplitude of >900 m/s. In the predawn sector, SAPS is seen as a region of antisunward convection equatorward of L = 3 (55° $Λ$), spanning ˜3° of latitude, with an average peak amplitude of 400 m/s.},

   abstract = {We investigate the fine-scale structure of the subauroral electric field in the vicinity of the polarization jet and subauroral ion drift (SAID) using coherent E region backscatter observed with the Millstone Hill 440 MHz UHF radar during a moderately disturbed period (Kp = 5) on 13 November 1998. We use a combination of data obtained at high time and spatial resolution and radar response modeling, incorporating magnetic aspect angle sensitivity and radar antenna beam shape. The modeled radar response function depends not only on the magnetic and radar pointing geometry but also on the altitude and extent of the irregularity layer. In addition to modeling of the radar system response, an optimal, regularized deconvolution technique is used to resolve fine-scale spatial structure from the relatively long pulse length used. At the 440 MHz Millstone radar frequency, coherent backscattered power is a linear function of electric field amplitude, and we are able to relate changes in the range variation of deconvolved power to spatial/temporal structure in the electric field. We observe the polarization jet to have superimposed multiple instances of narrow (0.1°) intense SAID configuration electric fields having lifetimes as short as 1.5 min and gradients on their equatorward edge as large as 4 mV/m per kilometer. Simultaneous DMSP satellite observations of westward ion drift across our experimental field of view confirms our interpretation of the radar data in terms of a subauroral polarization jet structure spanning over 3° latitude moving poleward at 250-400 m/s velocity (cross-L-shell) past the radar beam with superimposed intense SAID-like electric fields.},

Ionospheric data from European Space Agency's Swarm satellite constellation mission show prominent 6-day variations in the dayside low-latitude region at this time, which can be attributed to forcing from the middle atmosphere by the Rossby normal mode “quasi-6-day wave” (Q6DW). Geopotential height measurements by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Aura satellite reveal a burst of global Q6DW activity in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere during the SSW, which is one of the strongest in the record. The Q6DW is apparently generated in the polar stratosphere at 30–40 km, where the atmosphere is unstable due to strong vertical wind shear connected with planetary wave breaking. These results suggest that an Antarctic SSW can lead to ionospheric variability through wave forcing from the middle atmosphere.},

   abstract = {Major, sudden midwinter stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are large and rapid temperature increases in the winter polar stratosphere are associated with a complete reversal of the climatological westerly winds (i.e., the polar vortex). These extreme events can have substantial impacts on winter surface climate, including increased frequency of cold air outbreaks over North America and Eurasia and anomalous warming over Greenland and eastern Canada. Here we present a SSW Compendium (SSWC), a new database that documents the evolution of the stratosphere, troposphere, and surface conditions 60 days prior to and after SSWs for the period 1958-2014. The SSWC comprises data from six different reanalysis products: MERRA2 (1980-2014), JRA-55 (1958-2014), ERA-interim (1979-2014), ERA-40 (1958-2002), NOAA20CRv2c (1958-2011), and NCEP-NCAR I (1958-2014). Global gridded daily anomaly fields, full fields, and derived products are provided for each SSW event. The compendium will allow users to examine the structure and evolution of individual SSWs, and the variability among events and among reanalysis products. The SSWC is archived and maintained by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, doi:10.7289/V5NS0RWP/a).},

Details of the changes in parameterizations subsequent to the version in the original MERRA reanalysis are presented here. Results of a series of atmosphere-only sensitivity studies are shown to demonstrate changes in simulated climate associated with specific changes in physical parameterizations, and the impact of the newly implemented resolution-aware behavior on simulations at different resolutions is demonstrated. The GEOS-5 AGCM presented here is the model used as part of the GMAO MERRA2 reanalysis, global mesoscale simulations at 10 km resolution through 1.5 km resolution, the real-time numerical weather prediction system, and for atmosphere-only, coupled ocean-atmosphere and coupled atmosphere-chemistry simulations. The seasonal mean climate of the MERRA2 version of the GEOS-5 AGCM represents a substantial improvement over the simulated climate of the MERRA version at all resolutions and for all applications. Fundamental improvements in simulated climate are associated with the increased re-evaporation of frozen precipitation and cloud condensate, resulting in a wetter atmosphere. Improvements in simulated climate are also shown to be attributable to changes in the background gravity wave drag, and to upgrades in the relationship between the ocean surface stress and the ocean roughness. The series of resolution-aware parameters related to the moist physics was shown to result in improvements at higher resolutions and result in AGCM simulations that exhibit seamless behavior across different resolutions and applications.},

The Incoherent Scatter World Day campaign conducted on January 17-February 1, 2008 was arranged during a minor SSW event and focuses on studies of thermospheric and ionospheric response to stratospheric changes. We analyze ion temperature observations at 100-300 km height obtained by the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar (42.6°N, 288.5°E). Alternating regions of warming in the lower thermosphere and cooling above 150km altitude were observed by the radar. We use National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) temperature data at 10hPa (~30km) level and the F10.7 and Ap indices to identify any cause-effect relationship between observed variations in the temperature and stratospheric warming event. We conclude that the seasonal trend, solar flux and geomagnetic activity cannot account for the observed warming and cooling temperature variation and suggest that this variation is associated with stratospheric warming. This study demonstrates a link between the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere which has not been considered before and indicates that ionospheric variability as part of space weather should be considered in conjunction with stratospheric changes.

We focus on the American longitudinal sector with its extensive observational network of Global Navigation Satellite System receivers, four Digisondes located at low and middle latitudes, and the Arecibo and Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radars. The study focuses on a major SSW event of January 2013 to investigate large-scale disturbances in the nighttime ionosphere. We report a deep decrease in total electron content that reaches a factor of 2–5 as compared to the background level and is observed between local midnight and local sunrise (6–12 UT). This decrease is observed for several consecutive days in the range of latitudes from ~55°S to ~45°N. It is accompanied by a strong downward plasma motion and a significant decrease in ion temperature, as observed by both Arecibo and Millstone Hill radars. These results demonstrate that SSW events cause changes in the nighttime ionosphere that are even larger than in the daytime ionosphere. We discuss variations in electric field and F-region dynamics as possible drivers of this behavior and suggest that thermospheric winds play a much larger role than previously thought.},

Both the COSMIC observations and TIME-GCM simulations reveal perturbations in the F region peak height (hmF2) at Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes during SSW time periods. The perturbations are 20-30 km, which corresponds to 10-20% variability of the background mean hmF2. The TIME-GCM simulations and COSMIC observations of the hmF2 variability are in overall good agreement, and the simulations can thus be used to understand the physical processes responsible for the hmF2 variability. Through comparison of simulations with and without the migrating semidiurnal lunar tide (M2), we conclude that the midlatitude hmF2 variability is primarily driven by the propagation of the M2 into the thermosphere where it modulates the field-aligned neutral winds, which in turn raise and lower the F region peak height. Though there are subtle differences, the consistency of the behavior between the 2009 and 2013 SSWs suggests that variability in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude ionosphere and thermosphere is a consistent feature of the SSW impact on the upper atmosphere.},

  abstract  = {Solar thermal tides are planetary-scale waves in the neutral atmosphere with periods that are harmonics of 24 hours. In the thermosphere, they can achieve significant amplitude and can be the dominant source of variation in the atmosphere. Through their modification of the neutral atmosphere, they can also significantly modify the ionosphere, especially at low-latitudes where the dynamics of the Earth's ionosphere is determined to a large extent by the neutral atmosphere. Much recent work has focused on characterizing and understanding the impact of one sub-group of tides, known as non-migrating tides, on the ionosphere. Whereas migrating tides are responsible for creating strong day-night variations in the ionosphere, non-migrating tides create longitudinal variations in the ionosphere, the signature of which can only be detected with distributed networks of ground-based observations or spacecraft. The present work reviews the recent observations and modeling efforts that have helped to characterize and explain this longitudinal variability. Emphasis is placed on the characteristics of tides throughout the thermosphere, their impacts on the chemical composition of the thermosphere, and impacts on the ionosphere. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Basic processes of vertical coupling in the atmosphere-ionosphere system are discussed, focusing on the effects of internal waves, such as gravity waves and solar tides, sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), and of solar activity on the structure of the atmosphere. Internal waves play a crucial role in the current state and evolution of the upper atmosphere-ionosphere system. SSW effects extend into the upper atmosphere, producing changes in the thermospheric circulation and ionospheric disturbances. Sun, the dominant energy source for the atmosphere, directly impacts the upper atmosphere and modulates wave-induced coupling. The emphasis is laid on the most recent developments in the field, while giving credits to older works where necessary. Various international activities in atmospheric vertical coupling, such as SCOSTEP's ROSMIC project, and a brief contextual discussion of the papers published in the special issue are presented.},

We have observed an anomalous temporal variation of the vertical E × B drifts during the minor SSW event, showing a semidiurnal variation with very large amplitudes lasting for several days. Large differences in the E × B drifts were observed during a period of large increase of temperature and a large decrease of mean zonal wind, in the high latitude stratosphere (60°-90°N).

In this work we review the observed ion-neutral coupling effects at equatorial and low latitudes during large meteorological events called sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). Research in this direction has been accelerated in recent years mainly due to: (1) extensive observing campaigns, and (2) solar minimum conditions. The former has been instrumental to capture the events before, during, and after the peak SSW temperatures and wind perturbations. The latter has permitted a reduced forcing contribution from solar wind-magnetospheric processes. The main ionospheric effects are clearly observed in the zonal electric fields (or vertical E×B drifts), total electron content, and electron and neutral densities. We include results from different ground- and satellite-based observations, covering different longitudes and years. We also present and discuss the modeling efforts that support most of the observations. Given that SSW can be forecasted with a few days in advance, there is potential for using the connection with the ionosphere for forecasting the occurrence and evolution of electrodynamic perturbations at low latitudes, and sometimes also mid latitudes, during arctic winter warmings. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract  = {Traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) are the ionospheric signatures of atmospheric gravity waves. Their identification and tracking is important because the TIDs affect all services that rely on predictable ionospheric radio wave propagation. Although various techniques have been proposed to measure TID characteristics, their real-time implementation still has several difficulties. In this contribution, we present a new technique, based on the analysis of oblique Digisonde-to-Digisonde “skymap” observations, to directly identify TIDs and specify the TID wave parameters based on the measurement of angle of arrival, Doppler frequency, and time of flight of ionospherically reflected high-frequency radio pulses. The technique has been implemented for the first time for the Network for TID Exploration project with data streaming from the network of European Digisonde DPS4D observatories. The performance is demonstrated during a period of moderate auroral activity, assessing its consistency with independent measurements such as data from auroral magnetometers and electron density perturbations from Digisondes and Global Navigation Satellite System stations. Given that the different types of measurements used for this assessment were not made at exactly the same time and location, and that there was insufficient coverage in the area between the atmospheric gravity wave sources and the measurement locations, we can only consider our interpretation as plausible and indicative for the reliability of the extracted TID characteristics. In the framework of the new TechTIDE project (European Commission H2020), a retrospective analysis of the Network for TID Exploration results in comparison with those extracted from Global Navigation Satellite System total electron content-based methodologies is currently being attempted, and the results will be the objective of a follow-up paper.},

   abstract = {We present a statistical framework for estimating global navigation satellite system (GNSS) non-ionospheric differential time delay bias. The biases are estimated by examining differences of measured line-integrated electron densities (total electron content: TEC) that are scaled to equivalent vertical integrated densities. The spatiotemporal variability, instrumentation-dependent errors, and errors due to inaccurate ionospheric altitude profile assumptions are modeled as structure functions. These structure functions determine how the TEC differences are weighted in the linear least-squares minimization procedure, which is used to produce the bias estimates. A method for automatic detection and removal of outlier measurements that do not fit into a model of receiver bias is also described. The same statistical framework can be used for a single receiver station, but it also scales to a large global network of receivers. In addition to the Global Positioning System (GPS), the method is also applicable to other dual-frequency GNSS systems, such as GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema). The use of the framework is demonstrated in practice through several examples. A specific implementation of the methods presented here is used to compute GPS receiver biases for measurements in the MIT Haystack Madrigal distributed database system. Results of the new algorithm are compared with the current MIT Haystack Observatory MAPGPS (MIT Automated Processing of GPS) bias determination algorithm. The new method is found to produce estimates of receiver bias that have reduced day-to-day variability and more consistent coincident vertical TEC values.},

   abstract = {The ionosphere displays variations on a wide range of time-scales, ranging from operational time-scales of hours and days up to solar cycles and longer. We use ionosonde data from thirteen stations to study the day-to-day variability of the peak F2-layer electron density, NmF2, which we use to define quantitative descriptions of variability versus local time, season and solar cycle. On average, for years of medium solar activity (solar decimetric flux approximately 140 units), the daily fluctuations of NmF2 have a standard deviation of 20% by day and 33% by night. We examine and discuss the patterns of behaviour of ionospheric and geomagnetic variability, in particular the equinoctial peaks. For further analysis we concentrate on one typical midlatitude station, Slough. We find that the standard deviations of day-to-day and night-to-night values of Slough NmF2 at first increase with increasing length of the dataset, become fairly constant at lengths of 10–20 days and then increase further (especially at equinox) because of seasonal changes. We found some evidence of two-day waves, but they do not appear to be a major feature of Slough's F2 layer. Putting together the geomagnetic and ionospheric data, and taking account of the day-to-day variability of solar and geomagnetic parameters, we find that a large part of F2-layer variability is linked to that of geomagnetic activity, and attribute the rest to ‘meteorological’ sources at lower levels in the atmosphere. We suggest that the greater variability at night is due to enhanced auroral energy input, and to the lack of the strong photochemical control of the F2-layer that exists by day.},

We have used neutral winds specified from the extended version of the specified dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM-X), in which meteorology below 92km is constrained by atmospheric specifications from an operational weather forecast model and reanalysis. To assess the realism of the simulations against observations, we have carried out a case study during January-February 2009, a dynamically disturbed time characterized by a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) commencing 24 January 2009. Model results are compared with total electron content (TEC) from Jet Propulsion Laboratory global ionospheric maps. We show that SAMI3/SD-WACCM-X captures longitudinal variability in the equatorial ionization anomaly associated with nonmigrating tides, with strongest contributions coming from the diurnal eastward wave number 2 (DE2) and DE3. Both migrating and nonmigrating tides contribute to significant day-to-day variability, with TEC varying up to 16%. Our simulation during the SSW period reveals that at the Jicamarca longitude (285E) on 27 January 2009 nonmigrating tides contribute to an enhancement of the electron density in the morning followed by a decrease in the afternoon. An enhancement of the semidiurnal eastward wave number 2 (SE2) and SE3 nonmigrating tides, likely associated with the appearance of the SSW, suggests that these tides increase the longitudinal variability of the SSW impact on the ionosphere. The conclusion is that realistic meteorology propagating upward from the lower atmosphere influences the dynamo region and reproduces aspects of the observed variability in the ionosphere. Key Points Lower atmospheric contributions to ionosphere simulated during the 2009 SSW DE2 and DE3 tides are primary drivers of longitudinal variability during this period Semidiurnal nonmigrating tides play a role in SSW effects on ionosphere},

In this paper, we show that these fluid perturbations cause large-scale perturbations of the plasma drift and plasma density in the ionosphere by changing the wind dynamo and transport. These fluid perturbations modify both the amplitude and direction of the plasma drifts. Near the geomagnetic equator, the magnitude of the pre-reversal enhancement can be increased or weakened, depending on the location and local time. Because the circulation cells persist from late afternoon through midnight, the modulation of the vertical drift near the geomagnetic equator persists until midnight. The largest changes of the wind-driven currents can occur either in the E or F region and are determined by the magnitudes of the wind perturbations, conductivities, and conductivity perturbations. The contributions to the plasma transport changes are from advection by the neutral winds along field lines, plasma drifts, and ambipolar diffusion, in the order of their relative significance in the numerical results. © 2013.

The variation of zonal mean momentum flux of resolved gravity waves (with zonal wavelengths less than 1600 km) during SSW are qualitatively consistent with those obtained from parameterized studies, mainly caused by the change of filtering by the mean zonal wind. At high latitude in the winter hemisphere, stratospheric and mesospheric momentum fluxes vary rapidly during SSW, and their magnitudes decrease significantly following SSW, agreeing with satellite observations. Gravity waves are also found to vary as wave sources change. At tropical regions (especially in the summer hemisphere), convectively generated gravity waves increase due to enhanced deep convection following SSW. At higher latitudes, orographic waves vary during SSW as the wind changes extend from the stratosphere down into the troposphere. Gravity waves generated from adjustment of the polar jet also undergo significant changes during SSW. These changes lead to strong longitudinal variation of gravity waves.},

  abstract  = {We investigate the effects on the mesosphere and thermosphere from a strong mountain wave (MW) event over the wintertime Southern Andes using a gravity wave (GW)-resolving global circulation model. During this event, MWs break and attenuate at z∼50–80 km, thereby creating local body forces that generate large-scale secondary GWs having concentric ring structure with horizontal wavelengths λH=500–2,000 km, horizontal phase speeds cH=70–100 m/s, and periods τr∼3–10 hr. These secondary GWs dissipate in the upper mesosphere and thermosphere, thereby creating local body forces. These forces have horizontal sizes of 180–800 km, depending on the constructive/destructive interference between wave packets and the overall sizes of the wave packets. The largest body force is at z=80–130 km, has an amplitude of ∼2,400 m/s/day, and is located ∼1,000 km east of the Southern Andes. This force excites medium- and large-scale “tertiary GWs” having concentric ring structure, with λH increasing with radius from the centers of the rings. Near the Southern Andes, these tertiary GWs have cH=120–160 m/s, λH=350–2,000 km, and τr∼4–9 hr. Some of the larger-λH tertiary GWs propagate to the west coast of Africa with very large phase speeds of cH≃420 m/s. The GW potential energy density increases exponentially at z∼95–115 km, decreases at z∼115–125 km where most of the secondary GWs dissipate, and increases again at z>125 km from the tertiary GWs. Thus, strong MW events result in the generation of medium- to large-scale fast tertiary GWs in the mesosphere and thermosphere via this multistep vertical coupling mechanism.},

  abstract  = {We analyze quiet-time data from the Gravity Field and Ocean Circulation Explorer satellite as it overpassed the Southern Andes at z≃275 km on 5 July 2010 at 23 UT. We extract the 20 largest traveling atmospheric disturbances from the density perturbations and cross-track winds using Fourier analysis. Using gravity wave (GW) dissipative theory that includes realistic molecular viscosity, we search parameter space to determine which hot spot traveling atmospheric disturbances are GWs. This results in the identification of 17 GWs having horizontal wavelengths λH = 170–1,850 km, intrinsic periods τIr = 11–54 min, intrinsic horizontal phase speeds cIH = 245–630 m/s, and density perturbations (Formula presented.) 0.03–7%. We unambiguously determine the propagation direction for 11 of these GWs and find that most had large meridional components to their propagation directions. Using reverse ray tracing, we find that 10 of these GWs must have been created in the mesosphere or thermosphere. We show that mountain waves (MWs) were observed in the stratosphere earlier that day and that these MWs saturated at z∼ 70–75 km from convective instability. We suggest that these 10 Gravity Field and Ocean Circulation Explorer hot spot GWs are likely tertiary (or higher-order) GWs created from the dissipation of secondary GWs excited by the local body forces created from MW breaking. We suggest that the other GW is likely a secondary or tertiary (or higher-order) GW. This study strongly suggests that the hot spot GWs over the Southern Andes in the quiet-time middle winter thermosphere cannot be successfully modeled by conventional global circulation models where GWs are parameterized and launched in the troposphere or stratosphere.},

It is shown that gravity wave-induced variations in the neutral wind lead to plasma velocity variations both perpendicular and parallel to the geomagnetic field. Moreover, the electric field induced by the neutral wind perturbations can map to the conjugate hemisphere. Thus, electron density variations can be generated in both hemispheres which impact the total electron content (TEC) and 6300 Å airglow emission. It is found that the TEC exhibits variations of â‰±0.1 total electron content unit (1 TECU = 1016 el m-2) and the 6300 Å airglow emission variation is up to ∼±2.5% relative to the unperturbed background airglow.},

  abstract  = {Solar flares provide strong impulsive radiation and energy injection to the sunlit upper atmosphere. The impact on the ionosphere is immense in spatial scale, and therefore, it is not immediately evident if dramatically elevated neutral heating can lead to excitation of acoustic gravity waves. Using primary observations from Global Navigation Satellite System differential TEC (total electron content) over the continental United States, this paper presents postflare ionospheric observations associated with three X-class flares on 6, 7, and 10 September 2017. Postflare ionospheric changes had two significant morphological characteristics: (1) A few minutes after the X9.3 flare peak on 6 September, clear traveling ionospheric disturbance (TID) fronts emanated near the sunrise terminator with alignment parallel to its direction—TIDs propagated predominantly eastward into the dayside with a 150 m/s phase speed and a ∼30-min period; (2) synchronized differential TEC oscillations over continental United States with ∼60-min periodicity and damping amplitude over time, following all three X-class flares. Postflare ionospheric oscillation spectra exhibited significantly enhanced amplitudes and changes of periodicities (including the appearance of the 60-min oscillations). The Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar observed large ionospheric up-welling occurring nearly simultaneously as detected TIDs at the X9.3 flare peak, with up to 80 m/s enhancements in vertical drift at 500 km lasting for ∼30 min. Results suggest that significant solar flare heating and associated dynamical effects may be an important factor in TID/acoustic gravity wave excitation.},

This is the first paper concerning the simulation of TIDs generated by upward propagating gravity waves (GWs) that are spontaneously generated in the model. The dominant horizontal wavelengths of the simulated TIDs range from 700 to 1,500 km. The dominant periods and horizontal phase velocities of TIDs are 45–90 min and 250–300 m s−1, respectively. These features are the same as those of GWs in the 250–300 km height region. The phase of the electron density variations due to TIDs descends with increasing time, which is characteristic of the upward propagation of GWs. These electron density variations that are caused due to TIDs are explained by the transport processes of a neutral wind along a geomagnetic field line. These results indicate that the electron density variations respond locally to the passage of neutral wind fluctuations associated with upward propagating GWs. The GWs that excite TIDs are secondary GWs, which are generated in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere via the dissipation/breaking of tropospheric GWs. The magnitudes of TIDs at middle latitudes are larger in winter than in summer. The mechanisms of seasonal and day-to-day variations in TIDs that are caused due to GWs are discussed in this study.},

  abstract  = {This paper reports the first results of the 2D imaging of large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (LSTID) using GPS network data from China, combined with observations of these events using an ionosonde chain. 2D TEC perturbation maps for North America were also constructed to allow the study of LSTIDs on a global scale. During the medium storm on 28 May 2011, the onset of a substorm initiated a slow-speed LSTID over North America just after midnight. Subsequently, an LSTID reached China 1.5 hours later, at dusk. A second LSTID was observed over China before midnight, 6.6 hours after substorm onset. The phase fronts of the China events had a front width of at least 1600 km, and moved southwestwards at a speed of 540±85 m/s and 362±89 m/s, respectively. Ionosonde data addressed a downward vertical phase velocity of ∼75 m/s for the dusk event and ∼60 m/s for the night event. Although the nighttime LSTID travelled farther south than the earlier dusk event, both disappeared in South China, and this was due to increase of the attenuation at low latitudes. According to the energy dissipation equation of atmospheric gravity waves there is severe dissipation due to viscosity and heat conductivity at low latitudes, since such dissipation increases strongly with time; dissipation due to ion drag is less important but cannot be ignored because of enhancement in background TEC; In addition, uplift of the ionosphere at low latitudes is another factor that results in a reduced amplitude of TEC perturbation at low latitudes. © 2012.

  abstract  = {Large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (LSTIDs) were statistically studied using total electron content (TEC) data from the GPS Earth observation network (GEONET) in Japan during 45 months from April 1999 to December 2002. One hundred fifty-four LSTIDs propagating southward were identified with time sequences of two-dimensional TEC maps. Fifty LSTIDs were observed in 2000, 45 in 2001, and 38 in 2002. Their occurrence rate (occurrence probability of one LSTID per 3 hours) increased as Kp value increased, that is, 1% at Kp = 4 and 75% at Kp = 9. The disturbed-time LSTIDs were frequently observed over Japan in spring and autumn, which is consistent with the seasonal dependence of the geomagnetic disturbances. On the other hand, the number of LSTIDs under quiet conditions, Kp ≤ 3, reached 43, that is, 28% of all the LSTIDs. The wave parameters, such as the damping rate, horizontal velocity and direction, and period of the clear 58 LSTIDs were precisely determined. The amplitude of the quiet-time LSTIDs decreased during their passage over Japan for every event, while that of the disturbed-time LSTIDs not only decreased but also increased. The LSTIDs can be classified from these observational results into the following three types: the disturbed-time damping LSTIDs (DD-LSTIDs), the disturbed-time growing LSTIDs (DG-LSTIDs), and the quiet-time damping LSTIDs (QD-LSTIDs). The occurrence number of DD-LSTIDs, DG-LSTIDs, and QD-LSTIDs was 35 (60%), 11 (19%), and 12 (21%), respectively. The mean horizontal velocity, period, wavelength, and propagation direction of all LSTIDs were 475 ±171 m/s, 80 ± 29 min, 2131 ± 863 km, and 3 ± 19° east from south, respectively. Both the growth and decrease rates of the LSTIDs were correlated with their propagation velocities. An examination of the relation between the damping rates and the vertical propagation direction, 9, of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) which was derived from the horizontal velocity and the period of LSTIDs using the AGWs' dispersion relation, revealed that their damping and growth rates showed a clear correlation with θ. This correlation is due to the ion-drag effect, which is directly dependent on the angle between AGWs' propagation directions and the geomagnetic field. Considering the inclination of the geomagnetic field over Japan, both the damping and growing LSTIDs could be explained by the upward and downward propagating AGWs, respectively. The QD-LSTIDs had smaller θ which resulted from slower velocities and longer periods than those for the disturbed-time LSTIDs. These different characteristics would reflect those of the source mechanisms of the three types of LSTIDs. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The ionosphere is an electrically charged layer of Earth’s atmosphere that has a large impact on the transmitting and receiving of radio waves. Ionospheric variability modulates electromagnetic signals that propagate through the ionosphere, including the radio frequency range: 20 kHz to 300 GHz by bending, refracting, or absorbing the waves. This research uses high frequency, 3-30 MHz, radio receiving techniques to study the impact of the solar diurnal cycle on the ionosphere during the month of January 2020 from two locations. Data is analyzed and interpreted using python. By studying ionospheric variability, we are able to expand our knowledge on the ionosphere itself, as well as the relationship it has to radio communications.},

   abstract = {The dynamic ionosphere modifies both the frequency and amplitude of low (LF, 30-300 kHz) and high (HF, 3 – 30 MHz) frequency radio signals that propagate through the ionospheric medium. These ionospheric dynamics are often the result of varying solar inputs. Analyses of amplitude variations that impact the quality of communications links and frequency variations that significantly degrade on-the-air frequency measurements can be used to deduce underlying physical processes. Members of the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) present precision amplitude and frequency measurements made in Mico, TX of transmissions from the LF WWVB and HF WWV standard time and frequency stations located in Fort Collins, CO. During the 2017 North American Eclipse the signal amplitude of both 5 MHz WWV and 60 kHz WWVB increased 10 dB over a Colorado-Texas path, even though the entire path was completely below the path of totality. This data could be used to quantify the decrease in D layer absorption from diminished solar illumination. Over this same path and nearly every morning in response to sunrise the carrier of 5 MHz WWV has components observed to swing high in frequency by several hundred milliHertz and additionally split into multiple frequency tracks in a geometrically increasing progression that can peak as high as 3 Hz. Measurements of the upwards swing in frequency vs. time can be used to infer the descent rates of ionization in response to the increasing and descending sunlight that occurs at dawn. Similarly, the mode splitting can be used in analysis of multiple-hop modes as the rapidly increasing ionization enables propagation at higher angles. Additionally, we discuss science tradeoffs between single frequency and spectral analysis methods for frequency determination, the use of precise timing measurements on the WWV timing ticks to identify and quantify single and multi-hop propagation modes, the spectral mixing that occurs during simultaneous reception of stateside WWV and Hawaiian WWVB, and techniques for their separation into individual data records. Instrumentation block diagrams, data records, and propagation insights are given.},

These propagation conditions allow for other natural radio events like tweeks, whistlers, and chorus to propagate well within the Earth‐ionosphere waveguide. Using a simple E‐Field VLF receiver, a GPS timing receiver, a Raspberry Pi with Audioinjector soundcard, it is possible to build a fully contained low power VLF reception system to detect natural radio events in the VLF/ULF band using open source software that will capture, GPS timestamp, and filter (remove mains hum) the VLF audio feed and record, detect individual events, detect sudden ionospheric disturbances, and perform analysis on detected events.

The RBN and WSPRNet are two large‐scale High Frequency (HF, 3‐30 MHz) amateur (ham) radio observing networks that provide data to the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI). The LSTIDs were observed on the 7 and 14 MHz amateur radio bands, and are detected by observing changes in average propagation path length with time. LSTID period lengthened from T ~ 1.5 hr at 12 UT to T ~ 2.25 hr by 21 UT. Simultaneous LSTID signatures were present in ham radio observations over the continental United States, the Atlantic Ocean, and Europe. LSTIDs observed with amateur radio were consistent with LSTIDs observed by the Blackstone SuperDARN HF radar and in differential GNSS Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements. GNSS TEC maps were used to estimate LSTID parameters: horizontal wavelength 1100 km, phase velocity 950 km/hr, period 70 min, and propagation azimuth 135°. The LSTID signatures were observed throughout the day following ~800 nT surges in the Auroral Electrojet (AE) index at 00 and 12 UT. We will discuss potential generation hypotheses for the observed LSTIDs, including atmospheric gravity wave (AGW) sources triggered by auroral electrojet intensifications and associated Joule heating.},

In an effort to generate these additional measurements, the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI, hamsci.org) is working with the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation (TAPR, tapr.org), an engineering organization comprised of volunteer amateur radio operators and engineers, to develop a network of Personal Space Weather Stations (PSWS). These instruments that will provide scientific-grade observations of signals-of-opportunity across the HF bands from volunteer citizen observers as part of the NSF Distributed Array of Small Instruments (DASI) program. A performance-driven PSWS design (~US$500) will be a modular, multi-instrument device that will consist of a dual-channel phase-locked 0.1-60 MHz software defined radio (SDR) receiver, a ground magnetometer with (~10 nT resolution and 1-sec cadence), and GPS/GNSS receiver to provide precision time stamping and serve as a GPS disciplined oscillator (GPSDO) to provide stability to the SDR receiver. A low-cost PSWS (&lt; US$100) that measures Doppler shift of HF signals received from standards stations such as WWV (US) and CHU (Canada) and includes a magnetometer is also being developed. HF sounding algorithms making use of signals of opportunity will be developed for the SDR-based PSWS. All measurements will be collected into a central database for coordinated analysis and made available for public access.</p>},

Because most of a lightning discharge's spectral power is within the Very Low Frequency (VLF) and Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) bands, the emissions from lightning discharges (sferics) propagate rather easily across the globe. These propagation conditions allow for other natural radio events like tweeks, whistlers, and chorus to propagate well within the Earth‐ionosphere waveguide. Using a simple E‐Field VLF receiver, a GPS timing receiver, a Raspberry Pi with Audioinjector soundcard, it is possible to build a fully contained low power VLF reception system to detect natural radio events in the VLF/ULF band using open source software that will capture, GPS timestamp, and filter (remove mains hum) the VLF audio feed and record, detect individual events, detect sudden ionospheric disturbances, and perform analysis on detected events. VLF event data, recordings, and live streaming is possible, all from a PVC pipe active E‐Field antenna receiver, GPS timing receiver, and a Raspberry Pi.},

   abstract = {The amateur (ham) radio community is a global community of over 3 million people who use and build radio equipment for communications, experimentation, and science. By definition, amateur radio is a volunteer service, with the operators required to hold government-issued licenses that are typically earned by passing knowledge tests covering radio regulations and practices, radio theory, and electromagnetic theory. In the United States, there are about 750,000 licensed hams, ranging in age from very young to very old, and ranging in experience from neophyte to people with advanced degrees in radio engineering and science. Amateur radio operators are licensed to transmit on bands spread across the radio frequency (RF) spectrum, from very low frequency (VLF) up to hundreds of gigahertz. The purpose of these communications range from mission-critical emergency and public service communications to social contacts to highly competitive contests and achievement award programs. Many of these communications rely on trans-ionospheric paths, and therefore are heavily influenced by conditions in near-Earth space, or space weather. Amateurs today obtain space weather and propagation prediction information from sources such as the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), spaceweather.com, the Voice of America Coverage Analysis Program (VOACAP), amateur radio propagation columnists (ARRL, RSGB, and CQ Magazine), and spaceweatherwoman.com (Dr. Tamitha Skov). In order to predict success for their communications efforts, hams often use parameters such as smoothed sunspot number, 10.7 cm wavelength solar flux proxy, and the planetary Kp and Ap indices as inputs to predict radio propagation performance. Traditionally, these predictions focus on the driving influence of space conditions and the sun\{\textquoteright\}s output. However, frontier research in the space sciences community has revealed that for improved predictive success, much more information needs to be provided on neutral atmosphere dynamics from the lower atmosphere and its coupled effects on the ionosphere, and predictions need to be available at higher temporal and spatial resolution. Lower atmospheric influences include atmospheric gravity waves that can couple to traveling ionospheric disturbances that can dramatically alter radio propagation paths. Tropospheric phenomena such as temperature inversions and wind shear also affect VHF and UHF propagation. To be most useful, the ham community needs operational products that provide real time nowcasts and multi-day forecasts which predict how space weather through the whole atmosphere affects radio wave propagation on global scale and at all operational wavelengths. To help with this effort, hams can provide data with unique spatial and temporal coverage back to the research and forecast community. The amateur radio community has already started this process with the creation of multiple global-scale, real-time propagation reporting systems such as the Weak Signal Propagation Reporting Network (WSPRNet), PSKReporter, and the Reverse Beacon Network (RBN). Studies by the Ham radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) have shown that data from these systems, if applied correctly, can effectively be used to study ionospheric space weather events. Experienced amateurs keep detailed records of verified point-to-point contacts and have extensive experience operating under a wide variety of geophysical conditions and locations, both of which can provide unique insights when shared with the professional research community. In this presentation, we will describe efforts led by the HamSCI collective to provide this research community feedback through active HamSCI community email lists and annual HamSCI workshops. We will also describe strategies with good initial success at amateur-professional collaboration, including a HamSCI-led amateur radio community - professional research community partnership to create a network of HamSCI Personal Space Weather Stations (PSWS), which will allow citizen scientists to make science-grade space weather observations from their own backyards.},

Three receivers, components of the Intercepted Signals for Ionospheric Science (ISIS) Array software radio instrumentation network in the northeastern United States, recorded signals from two radio stations during 11 nights in March-April, 2012. By combining these measurements, TIDs were detected as approximately 40min periodic variations in the frequencies of the received signals resulting from Doppler shifts produced by the ionosphere. The variations had amplitudes of up to a few tenths of a hertz and were correlated across the array. For one study interval, 0000-0400 UT on 13 April 2012, simultaneous GPS total electron content, Digisonde®, and Super Dual-Auroral Radar Network coherent backscatter radar measurements confirmed the detection of TIDs with the same characteristics. Besides TIDs, the receiver network often detected large (nearly 1 Hz) upward (downward) Doppler shifts of the AM broadcast signals at the dawn (dusk) terminator. These results demonstrate that AM radio signals can be used for detection and monitoring of nighttime TIDs and related effects. Key Points AM radio signals can be used to detect and monitor nighttime TIDs Large up/down Doppler shifts of AM signals occur at the dawn/dusk terminator Layer height shift is the primary source of the TID-related Doppler shift},

  abstract  = {The polar vortices play a central role in vertically coupling the atmosphere from the ground to geospace by shaping the background wind field through which atmospheric waves propagate. This work extends the vertical range of previous polar vortex climatologies into the upper mesosphere. The mesospheric polar vortices are defined using the CO gradient method with Microwave Limb Sounder satellite data; the stratospheric polar vortices are defined using a stream function-based algorithm with data from meteorological reanalyses. Strengths and weaknesses of the two vortex definitions are given, as well as recommendations for when, where, and why to use each definition. Midwinter mean vortex geometry in the mesosphere is funnel shaped in the Arctic, with a wide top and narrow bottom. The Antarctic mesospheric vortex tapers with height in early winter and broadens with height in late winter. The seasonal evolution of mesospheric vortex frequency of occurrence, size, and zonal symmetry in both hemispheres is presented. Unexpected behavior above 60 km includes late season vortex broadening in both hemispheres, especially following winters without sudden stratospheric warmings. Following extreme stratospheric disturbances the polar night jet in the mesosphere strengthens and shifts poleward, resulting in a mesospheric vortex that contracts. Overall, the mesospheric polar vortices are more similar between the two hemispheres than their stratospheric counterparts. The vortex climatology presented here serves as an observational benchmark to which the mesospheric polar vortices in high-top climate models can be evaluated.},

  abstract  = {An empirical ionospheric model of the total electron content (TEC) over North America (20°-60°N, 40°-140°W) is constructed using the GPS TEC data collected by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Haystack Observatory during the years 2001-2012. This model is based on an analysis of quiet time monthly averages using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition technique, allowing for separation of spatial and temporal variations. The importance of different types of spatial-temporal variations to the overall TEC variability can be well represented by the characteristics of EOF basis functions and associated principal components coefficients, with various modes. The mode one EOF decomposition constitutes 97.5% of the total variance and therefore represents the essential feature of North America spatial and diurnal variation of the TEC. The mode two EOF, as reported in an earlier study, reveals a large and significant symmetric longitudinal variation of the ionosphere, organized with respect to magnetic declination. The mode three EOF decomposition shows midlatitude latitudinal structure that varies with season in a manner very similar to the so-called winter anomaly. Because of the quick convergence of EOF decomposition modes, the first four EOF modes are utilized for constructing a TEC empirical model. For each of the EOF modes, the temporal variations are expressed analytically in terms of local time, season, and solar activity, and the spatial variations by cubic-spline functions. An analysis of accuracy and quality indicates that this regional empirical TEC model can reflect the majority of the quiet time monthly means, and represent characteristic temporal-spatial variations in the North America.},

FISM2 is an empirical model of the solar ultraviolet irradiance created to fill spectral and temporal gaps in the satellite observations. FISM2 estimates solar ultraviolet irradiance variations due to the solar cycle, solar rotations, and solar flares. The major improvement provided by FISM2 is that it is based on multiple new, more accurate instruments that have now captured almost a full solar cycle and thousands of flares, drastically improving the accuracy of the modeled FISM2 solar irradiance spectra. Specifically, these new instruments are the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE)/X-ray Photometer System (XPS), and SORCE/Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE). FISM2 is also improved to 0.1-nm spectral bins across the same 0- to 190-nm spectral range and is already being used in research to estimate space weather changes due to solar irradiance variability in planetary thermospheres and ionospheres.},

  abstract  = {An uninterrupted multi-day (6–8 May 2013) ionospheric F-region event with features indicative of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) was detected with the Millstone Hill (MH) incoherent scatter radar (ISR). It was later identified, with the addition of Global Positioning System total electron content (GPS-TEC) imaging, as a novel ionospheric phenomenon. This phenomenon is herein termed semi-coherent ionospheric pulsing structures (SCIPS). The presumptive-MSTIDs in this multi-day event had a ~1 h period and were observed during calm-to-minor geomagnetic conditions using both the vertical-looking (Zenith) and steerable (Millstone Hill Steerable Antenna, or MISA) MH ISR systems. To image the MH MSTID events on a larger horizontal scale than is possible with ISR systems alone, a dense network of GPS TEC receivers was leveraged. The ISR-observed event was located in the GPS-TEC data geographically centered on the MH location with a ~100 km resolution (pixel size). However, keogram analysis of the GPS-TEC data revealed that the event had coherency across the continental United States. The same technique additionally exposed similar events occurring globally throughout the observing period. Our multi-instrument approach allows us to conclude that the event was comprised of large-scale and continuously forced, semi-coherent ionospheric pulsing structures (SCIPS) that masqueraded as MSTIDs when viewed locally. The GPS-TEC images show that the SCIPS were stationary in longitude on a global scale, but appeared to propagate in a southward direction in the Northern Hemisphere. It was not possible to obtain direct imaging in the southern hemisphere due to the smaller number of receivers. The SCIPS appear to originate at high latitudes and, in several instances, were coherent across over 10,000 km. The apparent high latitude source location, ubiquity, and large-scale coherence of the SCIPS suggest unexpected impulsive auroral oval sources containing enough energy to continually force the observed MSTID-like structures even during low geomagnetic activity periods.},

We selected eight nights with good all-sky imaging and Global Positioning System total electron content coverage, including five non–storm time periods with isolated initiations of geomagnetic activity and three storm main phase periods with continuous activity. Periods with LSTIDs generally started and stopped with initiation and cessation of activity. We found evidence that individual LSTIDs often show 1-1 correspondence with identifiable auroral disturbances, disturbances either being related to a substorm onset or to auroral streamers without a substorm. Since substorm ground magnetic depressions are directly related to the electric fields and electron precipitation of auroral streamers, we hypothesize that streamers may be the primary drivers of individual nightside LSTIDs with or without a substorm. Additionally, we found evidence that (1) LSTIDs detection is more likely near the longitude range of the initiating disturbance than further away, (2) the orientation of LSTID phase fronts depends on location relative to disturbance longitude, and (3) disturbance ionospheric current and magnetic latitude may influence whether a given disturbance leads to a detectable LSTID. Numerous LSTIDs (10 to 12 over 7- to 8-hr periods) were detected during southward interplanetary magnetic field periods of coronal mass ejection storm main phases, the vast majority reflecting streamers in the absence of substorms. Less LSTIDs were seen during the one examined high-speed-stream storm. We have also found evidence that omega band disturbances may drive interesting TIDs that are distinct from the LSTIDs driven by the substorm and streamer disturbances.},

The TEC is characterized by the large differences in the seasonally dependent absolute values, by the generally occurring spatially confined postsunset secondary maxima during solar maximum which are absent during solar minimum, and by the regularly appearing modulations of the structure due to TIDs. There is a definite seasonal and solar phase dependence in the characteristics of the TIDs. This is expressed in terms of their frequency of occurrence, likely phase of the diurnal variation during which the occurrences take place, their absolute magnitudes, and the time rate of change of these magnitudes.

The need for an HF channel model that is valid for both narrow and wide bandwidths over a more extensive range of channel conditions motivated the research reported in this paper. Wideband propagation, noise, and interference models have been developed and implemented in a real-time digital simulator that utilizes state-of-the-art signal processing hardware with a throughput in excess of 1 mega samples/s. The simulator architecture has the flexibility to permit its application to future simulator designs as faster signal processing components become available. The current simulation system can be used for simulating radio channels other than HF because the propagation, noise, and interference models are implemented in software.

The effects of D region absorption in the polar cap and auroral regions are integrated with the model through satellite measurements of the flux of energetic solar protons (>1 MeV) and the X-ray flux in the 0.1–0.8 nm band, and ground-based magnetometer measurements which form the Kp and Dst indices of geomagnetic activity. The model incorporates various features (e.g., convecting patches of enhanced plasma density) of the polar ionosphere that are, in particular, responsible for off-great circle propagation and lead to propagation at times and frequencies not expected from on-great circle propagation alone. The model development is supported by the collection of HF propagation measurements over several paths within the polar cap, crossing the auroral oval, and along the midlatitude trough.},

@article{Watterson1970,
   abstract = {Specially designed HF ionospheric propagation measurements were made and analyzed to confirm the validity and bandwidth limitations of a proposed stationary HF ionospheric channel model. In the model, the input (transmitted) signal feeds an ideal delay line and is delivered at several taps with adjustable delays, one for each resolvable ionospheric modal component. Each delayed signal is modulated in amplitude and phase by a baseband tap-gain function, and the delayed and modulated signals are summed (with additive noise) to form the output (received) signal. Statistical specifications for the tap-gain functions involved three hypotheses: 1) that each tap-gain function is a complex-Gaussian process that produces Rayleigh fading, 2) that the tap-gain functions are independent, and 3) that each tap-gain function has a spectrum that in general is the sum of two Gaussian functions of frequency, one for each magnetoionic component. Statistical tests were performed on daytime and nighttime measurements confirming the validity of the three hypotheses, and thereby the validity of the model. For practical applications, the model can be considered valid over a bandwidth equal to about one fourth of the reciprocal of the effective (weighted) time spreads on the ionospheric modal components. The model should be useful both in theoretical analyses of communication system performance and for channel simulator designs.

  abstract  = {The performance of an HF digital radio system is strongly affected by the response of its various protocols to short-term (sub-hourly) variations in the ionosphere. There is a very limited choice of models of this variation. Channel simulators based on the Watterson 2-path model (ITU-R F.1487) are commonly relied upon for modem testing, system design and modelling. Limited DSTO trials in the past have cast doubt on the validity of the Watterson model in the Australian mid-latitude region. In addition to fading errors, the Watterson model introduces further errors by ignoring variations in the group delay due to diffuse multi-path propagation. These concerns provided the impetus to conduct an extensive and rigorous trial to measure the narrow-band channel impulse response (CIR) at mid latitudes as well as the highly dynamic low latitude region of the ionosphere. A variety of low and mid-latitude narrowband HF channels were probed during a 14 day campaign in April 2006. Channel response measures such as Doppler shift and spread, group-delay spread, and signal fading statistics were used to identify a small set of similar channels by fuzzy clustering the response variables. By including or omitting other factors such as the carrier frequency, time of day, path information, ionospheric electron density profile parameters, and the maximum usable frequency from oblique ionospheric sounding on coincident paths, it is possible to establish various physical dependencies and derive a small selection of typical CIR records that define the cardinal channel types in the geographic region. In this paper the authors describe the trial, the measurements and the analysis methods used to characterise and statistically analyse the short-term properties of individual channel records and to cluster the channels into a manageable set of cardinal channel types. Important analysis results from the first campaign are presented.},

The residual component (Rx) may be regarded as an error which has a Standard Deviation of about 20 per cent. A new index (IF2) has been constructed for the period 1938-1954; like RM, it can also be regarded as giving an approximate value of Rv, but its residual error component (Rz) has an S.D. which is only about one tenth that of Rx. The magnitude of IF2, for a given month is computed from the mean noon critical frequencies in the F2-layer at Slough, Huancayo, and Watheroo, which are normally available within a few weeks of the end of each month. The index is based, in effect, on a calibration of the F2-layer critical frequencies at these observatories in terms of Rv, using data extending back as far as possible.

The ionosphere has crude arguments. The ionosphere is a giant layer that extends from 80 to 1000 km above Earth. The ionosphere contains free electrons and ions. These particles contribute to disturb the propagation of the electromagnetic waves that pass through the ionosphere. These particles could refract or disperse the electromagnetic waves that pass through the ionosphere. This paper will study the impact of the reflection and the absorption in the ionosphere for the propagation of the electromagnetic waves and what is the relation among them.

  abstract  = {The Ionosphere layer is used as a reflective mirror of the HF radio communications system. They have dynamic characteristics that are constantly changing at any time and place. It is need a reliable prediction system to be able to estimate the condition of the ionosphere. The term "forecast" is adopted for the practical schemes which are based on solar-terrestrial relations. In the case of zero lead-time, the forecast becomes a real-time probing of ionosphere, or well known as Real Time Channel Evaluation (RTCE) for HF communication. The term "now-casting" also used to describe an observation-intensive approach at very short term (up to one hour) ionopheric forecasting. Since the era of the 2000s the HF radio has advanced to be an intelligent HF radio system that is able to adapt to the condition of propagation at any time in order to maintain the quality of communication performance. The main component of the intelligent HF radio implementation is a low-power sounding/beacon system to probe the propagation conditions of each available HF channel. Implementation of sounding /beacon technology with small signal was of course still very secret, since then a group of scientists Amateur Radio member introduce/unlock this beacon/ sounding technology, which then called WSPR. With this openness of WSPR technology, we will replicate and integrate this small signal beacon/sounding technology in an intelligent HF communications system that is expected to be of immediate benefit to open communications in mountain-covered areas, in NVIS mode, or directly build HF radio networks throughout Indonesia in the sky wave mode, to respond to disaster mitigation. In this study we tried to carry out a simple probing/sounding technique by using WSPR. We concluded that the SNR of observations values are comparable with those of VOACAP simulation software Furthermore, we found that there is no difference observations results between two receivers located more than 100 Km away. We also concluded that both receivers only received sky wave signals.},

  abstract  = {This paper is a review of the basic theoretical dynamical properties of an atmosphere with an extended temperature strongly bound by gravity. The review begins with the historical developments leading up to the realization that the only dynamical equilibrium of an atmosphere with extended temperature is supersonic expansion. It is shown that sufficient conditions for supersonic expansion are T(r) declining asymptotically less rapidly than 1/r, or the density at the base of the corona being less than Nbgiven by (40) if no energy is available except through thermal conductivity, or the temperature falling within the limits given by (18) if T ∝ Nα-1 throughout the corona. Less extended temperatures lead to equilibria which are subsonic or static. The hypothetical case of a corona with no energy supply other than thermal conduction from its base is considered at some length because the equations may be solved by analytical methods and illustrate the transition from subsonic to supersonic equilibrium as the temperature becomes more extended. Comparison with the actual corona shows that the solar corona is actively heated for some distance into space by wave dissipation. The dynamical stability of the expanding atmosphere is demonstrated, and in a later section the radial propagation of acoustic and Alfvén waves through the atmosphere and wind is worked out. The calculations show that the magnetometer will probably detect waves more easily than the plasma instrument, but that both are needed to determine the mode and direction of the wave. An observer in the wind at the orbit of Earth can "listen" to disturbances generated in the corona near the sun and in turbulent regions in interplanetary space. The possibility that the solar corona is composed of small-scale filaments near the sun is considered. It is shown that such filamentary structure would not be seen at the orbit of Earth. It is pointed out that the expansion of a non-filamentary corona seems to lead to too high a calculated wind density at the orbit of Earth to agree with the present observations, unless T(r) is constant or increases with r. A filamentary corona, on the other hand, would give the observed wind density for declining T(r). It is shown that viscosity plays no important role in the expansion of an atmosphere either with or without a weak magnetic field. The termination of the solar wind, presumably between 10-103 AU, is discussed briefly. The interesting development here is the interplanetary Lαrecently observed, which may come from the interstellar neutral hydrogen drifting into the outer regions of the solar wind. Theory is at the present time concerned with the general dynamical principles which pertain to the expansion equilibrium of an atmosphere. It is to be expected that the rapid progress of direct observations of the corona and wind will soon permit more detailed studies to be carried out. It is important that the distinction between detailed empirical models and models intended to illustrate general principles be kept clearly in mind at all times. © 1965 D.

It exhibits a distinct change of slope at about n = 14 which is interpreted to mean that the field from the core dominates for n ⩽ 13 and the field from the crust for n ⩾ 15. The two portions of the spectrum are well represented by: Rn = 1.349 × 109 (0.270)n (nT)² for the core and Rn = 37.1 (0.974)n (nT)² for the crust. These representations can be used to establish order of magnitude inaccuracies in core field models due to crustal fields and due to inability to “observe” the core field wavelengths beyond n = 13 which are totally obscured by the crustal field.

A community science experiment in distributed Doppler shift measurement was conducted in October 2019 using the time station WWV, on the event of that station's centennial. Participants were asked to collect Doppler shift data from the WWV 5-MHz carrier via the open-source software program fldigi. This experiment garnered participation from stations across the country, demonstrating considerable volunteer interest: 45 recordings of WWV's 5-MHz beacon were collected. The novel element of this study is the use of distributed low-fidelity sensors in this geophysical domain, and the robust participation of the amateur radio community was enabled by inexpensive and readily available instrumentation. In this letter, we present an initial correlation analysis of the resultant data and discuss its implications for future long-term distributed Doppler networks. The data collected are in good agreement and, when examined together, offer some insights into regional trends. Despite the variety of equipment used by the amateur community, this community science approach shows promise for addressing the problem of undersampling in the geospace system.},

   abstract = {An experiment to investigate several characteristics of near vertical incidence skywave (NVIS) propagation (polarization, characteristic waves and their isolation, elevation angles, and radio noise) over a distance of 105 km and at 7 MHz was performed in The Netherlands. Daytime characteristic wave propagation with almost perfectly circular polarization and high isolation values had been expected from our earlier work and could now be demonstrated. Simultaneous elevation angle measurements showed pure single-hop F2-layer reflection and no ground wave component. Nighttime scattering with loss of polarization was observed when the critical frequency (fxF2) dropped below the operating frequency. The «Happy Hour» propagation, shown in our previous work [2], was confirmed with new measurements. The occurrence of a solar X-ray flare during the measurements provided a unique opportunity to compare the observations in a quiet ionosphere with those during a short wave fadeout (SWF). During the SWF, the signal strength of the ordinary wave dropped 35 dB and that of the extraordinary wave 45 dB. This lasted 15 min; recovery to normal signal levels took 35 min. The radio noise level, which was already low in the quiet rural measurement location, dropped another 12 dB during the SWF, with the remainder being generated locally. This proves that in a quiet rural location the major part of the radio noise arrives via the ionosphere.},

  abstract  = {Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) communication uses the ionosphere as a reflector to cover a continuous area with a radius of at least 150 km around the transmitter, on frequencies typically between 3 and 10 MHz. In developing countries, in areas lacking any other telecommunication infrastructure, it is used on a daily basis for voice and data communication. It may also be used in ad-hoc emergency (disaster) communication in other regions. This paper proposes optimum heights above ground for horizontal dipole antennas for NVIS, based on simulations and empirical data. First, the relationship between elevation angle and skip distance is obtained using ionospheric ray tracing. The high elevation angles found by simulation are confirmed by elevation angle measurements using a professional radio direction finder. The measurements also show the dominance of NVIS over ground wave propagation starting at a short distance. For these elevation angles, the optimum receive and transmit antenna heights above ground are derived using antenna simulations. A distinction is made between optimum transmit signal strength and optimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These optima are verified experimentally, demonstrating a novel evaluation method that can be used in the presence of the fading typical for ionospheric propagation. For farmland soil (σ ∼ 20 mS/m, εr ∼ 17) the optimum height above ground for the transmit antenna is 0.18-0.22λ. If the antenna is lowered to 0.02λ a transmit signal loss of 12 dB occurs. This corresponds with the theory. The receive antenna height, however, while appearing uncritical in the simulations, showed a clear optimum at 0.16λ and a 2-7 dB SNR deterioration when lowered to 0.02λ.},

  abstract  = {The term “sluggishness” was coined by E. V. Appleton in the 1950s to describe the time delay between peak irradiance at solar noon and the resulting peak in ionospheric electron density. Sluggishness can be understood as an inertial property of the ionosphere that manifests as a lag of the ionospheric response to a solar driver. As shown by Appleton, estimates of sluggishness can be used to study the chemistry of the lower ionosphere, of the D-region in particular. In this study, for the first time, we have examined ionospheric sluggishness in terms of the time delay between the peak irradiance during a solar flare and the resulting peak in ionospheric electron density using HF instruments. Estimates of the delay are obtained using HF observations from riometers and SuperDARN radars that are primarily sensitive to absorption in the D-region. Two new methods for measuring delay are introduced. Sluggishness is shown to be anti-correlated with peak solar X-ray flux and positively correlated with zenith angle and latitude. The choices of instrument, method, and reference solar waveband affect the sluggishness estimation. A simulation study was performed to estimate the effective recombination coefficient in the D-region. The coefficient was found to vary by orders of magnitude with peak flare intensity. We argue that the variation in effective recombination coefficient with peak flare intensity is highly sensitive to changes in the negative and positive ion chemistry of the D-region, which is sensitive to the incoming solar X-ray and EUV radiation.},

The PSWS magnetometers employ low-cost, commercial off-the-shelf, magneto-inductive sensor technology to record three-axis magnetic field variations with an adequate field resolution of ~10 nT at a 1 Hz sample rate. Data from the PSWS network will combine these magnetometer measurements with high frequency (HF, 3-30 MHz) radio observations to monitor large-scale current systems and ionospheric disturbances due to drivers from both space and the atmosphere. A densely-spaced magnetometer array, once established, will demonstrate their space weather monitoring capability in unprecedented spatial extent.

Full Stokes parameters were determined for bandwidths of 16 MHz. Here we present the first LWA1 results for the study of six Io-related events at temporal resolutions as fine as 0.25 ms. LWA1 data show excellent spectral detail in Jovian DAM such as simultaneous left-hand circular (LHC) and right-hand circular (RHC) polarized Io-related arcs and source envelopes, modulation lane features, S-burst structures, narrow band N events, and interactions between S bursts and N events. The sensitivity of the LWA1 combined with the low-radio-frequency interference environment allow us to trace the start of the LHC Io-C source region to much earlier CMLIII than typically found in the literature. We find that the Io-C starts as early as CMLIII = 230° at frequencies near 11 MHz. This early start of the Io-C emission may be valuable for refining models of the emission mechanism. We also detect modulation lane structures that appear continuous across LHC and RHC emissions, suggesting that both polarizations may originate from the same hemisphere of Jupiter. We present a study of rare S bursts detected during an Io-D event and show that drift rates are consistent with those from other Io-related sources. Finally, S-N burst events are seen in high spectral and temporal resolution and our data strongly support the cospatial origins of these events.},

The feature appears as radio band noise enhancement in which the frequency of enhancement increases and then decreases with time, forming a “triangular spectral feature.” The teepee tent shape leads to its name (TP for short). TPs usually have well-defined leading and trailing edges. While some TPs occur in isolation, they are often seen in groups, distributed either in time or in apex frequency. While most TPs appear diffuse, close-up views of a few TPs reveal that they actually consist of discrete bursts, highly suggestive of lightning strokes as possible radiation sources. Here, we investigate the possible generation of TPs by ionospheric reflection of radiation from remote lightning storms.},

   abstract = {After deriving from Ulysses-URAP measurements the low-frequency limit of the Jovian hectometer emission spectrum (250 ± 50 kHz at the -20 dB level below the emission peak), and confirming the absence of Io's control on Jovian radio emission below ∼1 MHz, we propose a single common explanation for these low-frequency limits: both are well explained by the quenching of the generation mechanism (the cyclotron-maser instability) where the ratio fpe/fce reaches a critical value (about 0.14) along the source field lines. This occurs in the external part of Io's plasma torus for the hectometer component, and in Io's dense plasma wake discovered by Galileo for the Io-dependent (decameter) component. As a consequence, we infer new constraints on Jovian radio source locations, which are found to extend along the L ≈ 6 field lines intersecting Io's wake (where the electron density is up to 10-20 times higher than in the average torus) for the Io-dependent decameter emission, and along L ≈ 7-9 field lines (with apex at ≈7-11 RJ) for the hectometer emission. We also infer that the broadband kilometer (auroral) emission originates from L > 10 field lines, with apex well beyond 12 RJ, closing in the distant Jovian magnetosphere or opened to the solar wind. These results confirm and precise the source locations obtained from direction-finding studies with Ulysses. Finally, we discuss implications in terms of source extent and of the origin of the accelerated electrons responsible for the emissions, and we derive lower limits on the proton concentration in Io's plasma wake. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Compilations of occurrence probability, average power flux density, and average sense of circular polarization are presented as a function of central meridian longitude, phase of Io, and frequency. The results are compared with ground-based observations. The necessary geometrical conditions and preferred polarization sense for Io-related decametric emission observed by Voyager from above both the dayside and nightside hemispheres are found to be essentially the same as those observed in earth-based studies. On the other hand, there is a clear local time dependence in the Io-independent decametric emission. The emission is prevalent at longitudes >200° when observed from over the dayside hemisphere but is dominant at longitudes <200° when observe from over the postmidnight sector. Decametric emission, which comprises the dynamic spectral lesser arcs near 10 MHz, displays a distinct, bimodal polarization pattern that is predominantly in the left-hand sense at longitudes below 150° and in the right-hand sense at longitudes above 150°. The central meridian longitude distributions of occurrence probability and average flux density at hectometric wavelengths appear to depend significantly on both the observer's latitude and local time. Io appears to have an influence on average flux density of the emission down to below 2 MHz. The average power flux density sectrum of Jupiter's emission has a broad peak near 9 MHz. Integration of the average spectrum over all frequencies and all longitudes gives a total radiated power for an equivalent isotropic source of 4 × 1011 W.},

  abstract  = {We have developed a method for displaying the spectral structure of Jupiter's decametric radio S bursts on timescales down to a few microseconds, 2 orders of magnitude finer than has been achieved elsewhere. By employing an extremely sensitive antenna (640 dipoles, at 26 MHz) and selecting only relatively weak S bursts that possess the simplest possible spectral shape, we identify frequently occurring structural features that we associate With localized emission centers. On timescales having better than about 30 μs resolution we find that the S burst baseband oscillation (and therefore the RF oscillation) is modulated to form distinct pulses, which we refer to as subpulses. Still finer time resolution reveals that within individual subpulses the baseband (and RF) oscillation often displays segments in which the usually drifting phase term abruptly becomes essentially constant and, after remaining so for 10 to 100 μs, abruptly resumes its random drift. It is these abruptly starting and ending segments of phase coherence that we attribute to isolated powerful centers of cyclotron maser wave amplification, which happen for brief intervals to be the only ones that are active. We believe that the more usual phase-incoherent condition (i.e., one in which the instantaneous frequency drifts randomly within the emission band) is due to the fact that the resultant radiation is the sum of two or more components from neighboring wave amplification centers emitting at slightly different frequencies, with independently varying intensities. Possible models for the production of subpulses and phase coherent intervals are discussed. Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Enhanced energy input to the cusp initiated by interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) southward turning triggers the LSTIDs, and each LSTID oscillation is correlated with a TEC enhancement in the dayside oval with tens of minutes periodicity. Equatorward-propagating LSTIDs are likely gravity waves caused by repetitive heating in the cusp. The cusp source can explain the high LSTID occurrence on the dayside during geomagnetically active times. Poleward-propagating ΔTEC patterns in the polar cap propagate nearly at the convection speed. While they have similar ΔTEC signatures to gravity wave-driven LSTIDs, they are suggested to be weak polar cap patches quasiperiodically drifting from the cusp into the polar cap via dayside reconnection.},

  abstract  = {Using a comprehensive database of ~5300 ground-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) stations we have investigated large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (LSTIDs) during 17–18 March 2015 (St. Patrick's Day storm). For the first time, the high-resolution, two-dimensional maps of the total electron content perturbation were made using not only GPS but also GLONASS measurements. Several LSTIDs originated from the auroral regions in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres were observed simultaneously over Europe, North America, and South America. This storm is considered as a two-step main phase storm. During the first main phase LSTIDs propagated over the whole daytime European region and over high latitudes of North America. During the second main phase we report (1) intense LSTIDs propagated equatorward in North America and Europe, (2) convergence of several LSTIDs originated from the opposite hemispheres in the interference zone over geomagnetic equator in South America, and (3) “super” LSTIDs with the wavefront length of more than 10,000 km observed simultaneously in North America and Europe. LSTIDs observed in three sectors had wavelength of ~1200–2500 km and wave periods of ~50–80 min. During the recovery phase on the background of the negative ionospheric storm developed over North America we detect signatures of the stream-like structures elongated within the latitudinal range of 29°N–42°N across the U.S. These structures persisted through the nighttime to the early morning from 04 UT to 13 UT on 18 March 2015, and they were associated with the subauroral polarization stream-induced nighttime ionospheric flows.},

   abstract = {Some of the analysis of gravity wave generation and dissipation in the thermosphere given in a previous paper is extended by defining wave energy for gravity waves of arbitrary amplitude and by analyzing several numerical simulations. Wave energy as defined in this paper is closely related to the sum of kinetic energy and available potential energy of the atmosphere. In the absence of production or dissipation mechanisms, wave energy is approximately, but not strictly conserved. Its dissipation is related to, but in general is not the same as, entropy generation. Numerical simulations substantiate the findings that both the Lorentz force and the Joule heating of auroral currents can generate substantial gravity wave energy but that the waves produced by Joule heating are more capable of traveling to middle and low latitudes. The simulations also reveal that molecular dissipation of wave energy can be relatively less important, in comparison to daytime Joule dissipation, than simple treatment previously indicated.},

During a measurement campaign, aimed at recovering large-scale wave-like processes in the upper atmosphere, in March 2001 at the MIT Haystack Observatory (Millstone Hill, MA), a Digisonde Portable Sounder (DPS) made simultaneous observations with the incoherent scatter radar (ISR). The DPS was upgraded to include the frequency and angular sounding (FAS) technique previously developed at the Institute of Radio Astronomy in Kharkov, Ukraine, for TED diagnostics. The DPS with four spaced receive antennas received the radio signals at 3.33 MHz and 7.335 MHz from Radio CHU of the Canadian Time Service (0ttawa, Ontario). The FAS technique recovered the basic parameters of TIDs, i.e., amplitude, speed, and the direction of the propagation vector by modeling the ionosphere as a perfectly reflecting surface. For three days during the campaign the Millstone Hill ISR monitored the ionospheric midpoint using a triangulation mode to identify the direction of motion and speed of the wave-like ionospheric disturbances. Comparison of the results from the two diagnostic techniques showed good agreement. The wave directions were within 10 to 15 degrees, and speed and wavelength were within 10 to 12%.},

Each GPS satellite transmits signals at two different L‐band frequencies, L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2 (1227.6 MHz). The total electron content (TEC) along the path to each satellite can be determined by combining both frequencies using the pseudorange and the phase data. The GPS data is input into a Kalman filter, which is used to predict the coefficients of a simple TEC model with azimuth and elevation dependence. This model takes advantage of the real‐time knowledge of the variations in TEC around the radar site provided by the GPS data. The coefficients for this model are then sent to the satellite tracking computer, and the model is applied in real time to account for the ionospheric path delay to whatever satellite is currently in track. The preliminary results of using this ionospheric monitoring system are discussed. 1992 Institute of Navigation},

The eclipse shadow has a supersonic motion which is theoretically expected to generate atmospheric bow waves, similar to a fast-moving river boat, with waves starting in the lower atmosphere and propagating into the ionosphere. However, previous geographically limited observations have had difficulty detecting these weak waves within the natural background atmospheric variability, and the existence of eclipse-induced ionospheric waves and their evolution in a complex coupling system remain controversial. During the 21 August 2017 eclipse, high fidelity and wide coverage ionospheric observations provided for the first time an oversampled set of eclipse data, using a dense network of Global Navigation Satellite System receivers at ∼2,000 sites in North America. We show the first unambiguous evidence of ionospheric bow waves as electron content disturbances over central/eastern United States, with ∼1 h duration, 300–400 km wavelength and 280 m/s phase speed emanating from and tailing the totality region. We also identify large ionospheric perturbations moving at the supersonic speed of the maximum solar obscuration which are too fast to be associated with known gravity wave or large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbance processes. This study reveals complex interconnections between the Sun, Moon, and Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere and demonstrates persistent coupling processes between different components of the Earth's atmosphere, a topic of significant community interest.},

The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple.

The second one, X9.3, which is the most intensive SF in the current solar cycle, peaked at 12:02 UT and was accompanied by solar radio emission. In this work, we study ionospheric response to the two X-class SFs and their impact on the Global Navigation Satellite Systems and high-frequency (HF) propagation. In the ionospheric absolute vertical total electron content (TEC), the X2.2 SF caused an overall increase of 2–4 TECU on the dayside. The X9.3 SF produced a sudden increase of ~8–10 TECU at midlatitudes and of ~15–16 TECU enhancement at low latitudes. These vertical TEC enhancements lasted longer than the duration of the EUV emission. In TEC variations within 2–20 min range, the two SFs provoked sudden increases of ~0.2 TECU and 1.3 TECU. Variations in TEC from geostationary and GPS/GLONASS satellites show similar results with TEC derivative of ~1.3–1.7 TECU/min for X9.3 and 0.18–0.24 TECU/min for X2.2 in the subsolar region. Further, analysis of the impact of the two SFs on the Global Navigation Satellite Systems-based navigation showed that the SF did not cause losses-of-lock in the GPS, GLONASS, or Galileo systems, while the positioning error increased by ~3 times in GPS precise point positioning solution. The two X-class SFs had an impact on HF radio wave propagation causing blackouts at <30 MHz in the subsolar region and <15 MHz in the postmidday sector.},

We investigate how these various indices relate to nightside auroral power by using both particle (DMSP) and image (Polar Ultraviolet Imager (UVI)) data. The best correlation is between SME and total nightside auroral power, namely, r = 0.86. Hence, nearly 3/4 of the minute-by-minute variance in nightside power can be determined by SME alone. Interestingly, although the geophysical meaning of AE(12) has sometimes been challenged, we show that even that index correlates at the r = 0.81 level, or 2/3 of the variance, in nightside power. Most auroral power stems from the diffuse aurora, with a linear relationship between the auroral electrojet indices and nightside diffuse power. Thus, SME has a clear geophysical meaning: It samples the thermal portion of the magnetotail plasma sheet. We study how well SML (the generalization of AL) identifies substorms in two types of tests. The first is a comparison with a set of 1081 substorms determined from Polar UVI in 1997-1998, and the second is the use of DMSP particle precipitation data for superposed epoch analysis. The same algorithm applied to SML is much more likely (about 50% more likely) to identify an onset seen by UVI than is AL(12). Even when both indices can be used to identify onsets, the median delay after imaging onset until the AL indicator is less than half using SML (about 4 min versus 8 min). There are 10,719 onsets in the SML data between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2002, of which 5084 are isolated. Isolated SML onsets behave almost identically to the onsets determined by global imagers. Specifically, they represent the same sharp spike in auroral power, which is most pronounced in broadband (wave) precipitation, with the same duration and subsequent recovery. However, recurrent substorms (those following less than 2 h after a previous onset) rise from a higher baseline by a smaller percentage but with the same absolute change in auroral power, thus reaching a higher peak power.

  abstract  = {A generalization of the traditional 12-station auroral electrojet (AE) index to include more than 100 magnetometer stations, SME, is an excellent predictor of global auroral power (AP), even at high cadence (1 min). We use this index, and a database of more than 53,000 substorms derived from it, covering 1980-2009, to investigate time and energy scales in the magnetosphere, during substorms and otherwise. We find, contrary to common opinion, that substorms do not have a preferred recurrence rate but instead have two distinct dynamic regimes, each following a power law. The number of substorms recurring after a time Δt, N(Δt), varies as Δt-1.19 for short times (<80 min) and as Δt-1.76 for longer times (>3 hours). Other evidence also shows these distinct regimes for the magnetosphere, including a break in the power law spectra for SME at about 3 hours. The time between two consecutive substorms is only weakly correlated (r = 0.18 for isolated and r = 0.06 for recurrent) with the time until the next, suggesting quasiperiodicity is not common. However, substorms do have a preferred size, with the typical peak SME magnitude reaching 400-600 nT, but with a mean of 656 nT, corresponding to a bit less than 40 GW AP. More surprisingly, another characteristic scale exists in the magnetosphere, namely, a peak in the SME distribution around 61 nT, corresponding to about 5 GW precipitating AP. The dominant form of auroral precipitation is diffuse aurora; thus, these values are properties of the magnetotail thermal electron distribution. The characteristic 5 GW value specifically represents a preferred minimum below which the magnetotail rarely drops. The magnetotail experiences continuous loss by precipitation, so the existence of a preferred minimum implies driving that rarely disappears altogether. Finally, the distribution of SME values across all times, in accordance with earlier work on AE, is best fit by the sum of two distributions, each normal in log(SME). The lower distribution (with a 40% weighting) corresponds to the characteristic quiet peak, while the higher value distribution (60% weighting) is an average over the characteristic substorm peak and the subsequent prolonged recovery.

PFISR is a 128-panel (upgraded from 96 panels in September 2007) AMISR system installed at the Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks, Alaska. The pulse-to-pulse steering capabilities of AMISR support the measurement of line-of-sight velocities in multiple look directions essentially simultaneously. This capability in turn allows electric fields and neutral winds to be resolved with minimal assumptions regarding time stationarity of the medium. The multibeamforming capability also allows additional flexibility in the estimation of those parameters, for which experiment planning can become very important. The approach described herein is ideally suited for such planning, is appropriate for the overdetermined problem characteristic of AMISR measurements, and allows in a simple way for the inclusion of appropriate a priori information such as the assumption of negligible parallel electric fields and negligible vertical neutral winds. We present some case studies from the PFISR that demonstrate some of the new capabilities.},

The statistical characteristics of both altitude-resolved and altitude-integrated energy transfer rates in the auroral E region local to PFISR during different geomagnetic conditions are quantified. Our analysis shows that the geomagnetic activity level has large impacts on the energy transfer rates. In contrast with previous investigations, we find both the altitude integrated electromagnetic (EM) energy transfer rate and Joule heating rate are larger in the evening sector than in the morning sector during all geomagnetic activity conditions. We also observe a non-negligible negative EM energy transfer rates below 110 km in the morning sector during active conditions, which is associated with neutral winds during this MLT interval. The statistical results show that the neutral winds tend to increase the Joule heating rate in a narrow altitude range in the morning sector and impact a broader region with respect to altitude and time in the evening sector in the E region under moderate and active conditions. We find that during quiet conditions that the neutral winds have a significant contribution to the Joule heating and contribute up to 75% of the Joule heating. However, during active conditions the enhanced electric fields are a dominant driver of Joule heating, while the neutral wind effects can reduce the Joule heating rates by 25% or more relative to the passive heating rates.},

  abstract  = {A new method for measuring the ionosphere plasma autocorrelation function with an incoherent scatter radar is described. This method can be used in similar situations where multipulse methods have been used previously. In situations where the design of the transmitted signal is limited by a maximum allowed modulation time and a maximum radar peak power and where the signal to noise ratio is small, this method provides significantly more accurate ACF estimates than can be obtained by frequency commutated multiple pulse measurements. A simple explanation of the method is given, as well as a precise definition based on ambiguity functions. Computational algorithms are discussed, and it is shown that there are several possibilities to modify present algorithms so that this method can be implemented.

While existing instrument networks provide excellent insight into ionospheric and space science, the system remains undersampled and more observations are needed to advance understanding. In an effort to generate these additional measurements, the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI, hamsci.org) is working with the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation (TAPR, tapr.org), an engineering organization comprised of volunteer amateur radio operators and engineers, to develop a network of Personal Space Weather Stations (PSWS). These instruments that will provide scientific-grade observations of signals-of-opportunity across the HF bands from volunteer citizen observers as part of the NSF Distributed Array of Small Instruments (DASI) program. A performance-driven PSWS design (~US500) will be a modular, multi-instrument device that will consist of a dual-channel phase-locked 0.1-60 MHz software defined radio (SDR) receiver, a ground magnetometer with (~10 nT resolution and 1-sec cadence), and GPS/GNSS receiver to provide precision time stamping and serve as a GPS disciplined oscillator (GPSDO) to provide stability to the SDR receiver. A low-cost PSWS (&lt; US100) that measures Doppler shift of HF signals received from standards stations such as WWV (US) and CHU (Canada) and includes a magnetometer is also being developed. HF sounding algorithms making use of signals of opportunity will be developed for the SDR-based PSWS. All measurements will be collected into a central database for coordinated analysis and made available for public access.</p>},

Although mid-latitude spread F has been widely studied, the plasma instability mechanisms for these irregularities are still largely unknown. This phenomenon can cause radio wave scintillation effects that degrade the performance of man-made technologies such as satellite communications and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Understanding these irregularities so that they can be anticipated and mitigated are important aspects of space weather research. The occurrence climatology and variability can also be helpful in modeling efforts of these irregularities. Here, we present signatures of mid-latitude irregularities observed in oblique ionograms received near Scranton, PA transmitted by the Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar (ROTHR) in Chesapeake, Virginia. These observations are collected with the GNU Chirpsounder2 software, an open-source software package capable of creating ionograms from frequency modulated (FM) chirp ionosondes. This ionospheric sounding mode will be implemented in the currently under development Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS), a ground-based multi-instrument system designed to remote-sense the ionosphere using signals of opportunity.</span></p>},

On 3 November 2017, LSTID signatures were detected in simultaneously over the continental United States in observations made by global High Frequency (HF) amateur (ham) radio observing networks and the Blackstone (BKS) SuperDARN radar. The amateur radio LSTIDs were observed on the 7 and 14 MHz amateur radio bands as changes in average propagation path length with time, while the LSTIDs were observed by SuperDARN as oscillations of average scatter range. LSTID period lengthened from T ~ 1.5 hr at 12 UT to T ~ 2.25 hr by 21 UT. The amateur radio and BKS SuperDARN radar observations corresponded with Global Navigation Satellite System differential Total Electron Content (GNSS dTEC) measurements. dTEC was used to estimate LSTID parameters: horizontal wavelength 1136 km, phase velocity 1280 km/hr, period 53 min, and propagation azimuth 167. The LSTID signatures were observed throughout the day following ~400 to 800 nT surges in the Auroral Electrojet (AE) index. As a contrast, 16 May 2017 was identified as a period with significant amateur radio coverage but no LSTID signatures in spite of similar geomagnetic conditions and AE activity as the 3 November event. We hypothesize that atmospheric gravity wave (AGW) sources triggered by auroral electrojet intensifications and associated Joule heating are the source of the LSTIDs, and that seasonal neutral atmospheric conditions may play a role in preventing AGW propagation in May but not in November.</p>},

This will create an unprecedented opportunity to probe the ionosphere at finer resolution in both time and space as all measurements will be collected into a central database for coordinated analysis. Individual nodes are being designed to service the needs of the professional space science researcher while being cost-accessible and of interest to amateur radio operators and citizen scientists. At the heart of the HamSCI PSWS will be a high performance 0.160 MHz software defined radio (SDR) [1] with GNSS-based precision timestamping and frequency reference. This SDR is known as the TangerineSDR and is being developed by the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio (TAPR) amateur radio organization. The primary objective of PSWS system is to gather observations to understand the short term and small spatial scale ionospheric variabilities in the ionosphere-thermosphere system. These variabilities are important for understanding a variety of geophysical phenomena such as Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) [2], Ionospheric absorption events, geomagnetic storms and substorms.

This system is being designed with the intention of distribution to a large number of amateur radio and citizen science observers. This will create an unprecedented opportunity to probe the ionosphere at finer resolution in both time and space as all measurements will be collected into a central database for coordinated analysis. Individual nodes are being designed to service the needs of the professional space science researcher while being cost-accessible and of interest to amateur radio operators and citizen scientists. At the heart of the HamSCI PSWS will be a high performance 1  50 MHz software defined radio (SDR) with GNSS-based precision timestamping and frequency reference. This SDR is known as the TangerineSDR and is being developed by the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio (TAPR) amateur radio organization. The primary objective of PSWS system is to gather observations to understand the short term and small spatial scale ionospheric variabilities in the ionosphere-thermosphere system. These variabilities are important for understanding a variety of geophysical phenomena such as Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs), Ionospheric absorption events, geomagnetic storms and substorms. We present early results suggesting signatures of Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) from an ionospheric sounding mode that we intend to implement on the PSWS system, currently implemented on an Ettus N200 Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) using the open source GNU Chirpsounder data collection and analysis code.</p>},

  abstract  = {<p>The HamSCI community has been studying apparent frequency shifts in the reception of HF skywave signals from radio station WWV in Ft. Collins, CO. WWV is a standard time and frequency station with atomic clock accuracy. If the receiving station uses a GPS Disciplined Oscillator (GPSDO) for a frequency reference, the atomic clock accuracy on both ends guarantees any observed frequency shifts are attributable only to propagation effects through the ionosphere. Causes for frequency shifts in the received signal are recognized as complex and varied. A leading candidate is Doppler shift resulting from dynamic changes in refraction layer height. These, in turn, are caused by the diurnal transitions between night and day, passage of an eclipse shadow, and ionospheric disturbances originating from solar flares or X-ray events. For the case of changing refraction layer height, an analysis of Doppler frequency and Time of Flight (TOF) data can estimate the changes in skywave path length between the transmitter and receiver.&nbsp; This data can be used in conjunction with an assumed geometric model and propagation mode to infer the corresponding height profile over time. This paper postulates one possible mechanism for observed frequency swings and presents supporting experimental evidence. Comparisons between the calculated&nbsp; height profile derived from Doppler data and data from ray trace programs and ionosonde measurements are given.</p>},

The PSWS magnetometers employ low-cost, commercial off-the-shelf, magneto-inductive sensor technology to record three-axis magnetic field variations with an adequate field resolution of ~10 nT at a 1 Hz sample rate. Data from the PSWS network will combine these magnetometer measurements with high frequency (HF, 3-30 MHz) radio observations to monitor large-scale current systems and ionospheric disturbances due to drivers from both space and the atmosphere. A densely-spaced magnetometer array, once established, will demonstrate their space weather monitoring capability in unprecedented spatial extent. Magnetic field data obtained by the magnetometers installed at three locations across the US are presented and compared with the existing magnetometers nearby.&nbsp;</p>},

In particular, ionospheric density observations from sources such as the global satellite navigation system (GNSS) allow a quantitative, numerate discussion of earthquake drivers in both time and space dimensions as compared to other known lower atmosphere ionospheric variability drivers.&nbsp; Phil will conclude with a discussion of the implications for earthquake associated HF propagation effects in the face of observed day-to-day ionospheric density variability.</p>},

  abstract  = {<p>Traveling lonospheric Disturbances (TIDs) are propagating variations in ionospheric electron densities that affect radio communications and can help with understanding energy transport throughout the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-neutral atmosphere system. Large scale TIDs (LSTIDs) have periods T\ 30-180\ min, horizontal phase velocities v_H‍100-‍250 m/s, and horizontal wavelengths λ_H&gt;1000 km and are believed to be generated either by geomagnetic activity or lower atmospheric sources. TIDs create concavities in the ionospheric electron density profile that move horizontally with the TID and cause skip-distance focusing effects for high frequency (HF, 3-30 MHz) radio signals propagating through the ionosphere. The signature of this phenomena is manifest as quasi-periodic variations in contact ranges in HF amateur radio communication reports recorded by automated monitoring systems such as the Weak Signal Propagation Reporting Network (WSPRNet) and the Reverse Beacon Network (RBN). First in this study, members of the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) present a case study showing consistency in LSTID signatures in RBN and WSPRNet are also present in Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and ionosonde measurements. Then, we present a climatology of LSTID activity as well as&nbsp; using RBN and WSPRNet observations on the 1.8, 3.5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 MHz amateur radio bands from 2017.

  abstract  = {<p>The first radio echoes with long delays were reported in 1927 by Jørgen Hals in Oslo, Norway on 9.54 MHz signals from the Netherlands. His first report exists at the National Library in Oslo and was later reported in Nature [Størmer, 1928]. Controlled experiments where delays ranged from 3 to 30 seconds confirmed the phenomenon and convinced most skeptics that the phenomenon was real [van der Pol, 1928]. About 15 different hypotheses have been presented over time for their cause [Shlionskiy 1985]. The five most likely ones will be presented here. They involve phenomena with long-distance travel such as around the world many times or reflection from plasma clouds. Another scenario is where the speed of propagation is substantially slower than normal as if there is mode conversion to mechanical waves in the ionosphere with or without nonlinearity [Vidmar, Crawford 1985]. The only one of the five which is understood well is when a signal is ducted in the magnetosphere and reflected from the opposite hemisphere. It may occur for frequencies up to 4 MHz and will give delays of up to 0.5 seconds. The further north, the longer the delay. Therefore, such medium delay echoes may sometimes be confused with round-the-world echoes of 138 ms, which however seldom occur at such low frequencies. There are examples of such echoes from Tasmania and St. Petersburg in the scientific literature. Amateur operator reports from New York, Georgia, California, Newfoundland, Denmark, and the UK [Martinez, 2007] from the last decades will be presented and analyzed and audio from some of them will be demonstrated. The delay is predictable from geomagnetic latitude using a simplified dipole model for the geomagnetic field line [Holm 2009]. The effect occurs during the dark hours and is most likely during winter months of years of low solar activity. A good report of such a phenomenon should involve a digital recording of audio using CW and not SSB signals. Delay measurement with amateur radio equipment is a challenge and needs to compensate for the usual delay between the onsets of the transmitter and sidetone signals.</p>},

  abstract  = {<p>Mid-latitude sporadic-E clouds (commonly abbreviated as Es) are a transient feature consisting of thin layers of dense, but patchy, ionization which occur in the E region of the ionosphere. The process of formation is different from that of the rest of the ionosphere and it can produce much higher electron densities, sometimes permitting oblique reflection of radio waves up to 150 MHz.<br />
The mechanism for the oblique reflection of VHF waves from Es layers has not been well described, with candidates including specular reflection, scattering, and magneto-ionic double refraction. The polarization and fading characteristics of waves reflected from Es layers are proposed as a marker for the presence or absence of magneto-ionic effects.&nbsp;<br />
An experimental system has been developed for rapid and accurate polarization and fading measurements at 50 MHz. The overall sensitivity of the system has been optimized by reducing environmental electromagnetic noise, giving the ability to observe weak, short-lived Es propagation events. The effect of the ground reflection on observed polarization has been analyzed and the induced amplitude and phase biases compensated for.<br />
A measurement campaign in the summer of 2018 gathered a large quantity of data, using amateur 50 MHz beacons, at distances between 1,000 km and 1,650 km, as signal sources. The results provide compelling evidence that Es-layer propagation at 50 MHz exhibits the characteristics of magneto-ionic double refraction, but the thin, intense and variable nature of the reflecting region means that the reflected signals can have quite extreme characteristics. Some of the results are surprising, and are yet to be explained convincingly.<br />
In this presentation, an overview of the experimental technique will be given, and the results described. Some of this information has already been published, but much of it is new.</p>},

Such studies include propagation across the Boreal and Austral Auroral Ovals with the ship working in the Polar Regions, or, as in this case, on mid-latitude propagation with the ship on transit. For RV Polarsterns voyage from Gran Canaria (27.5oN) to Neumayer III station, Antarctica (70.5oS) from 27 December 2020  18 January 2021 a WSPR transmitter (DP0POL) operated on all bands 16010 meters. Heatmaps of the number of spots received in Europe and North America each hour, each day, and on each band have been generated from the WSPR data held on the WsprDaemon server. These spot-count heatmaps, proxies for circuit reliability, clearly delineate the diurnal variation in band opening times and how those diurnal variations vary systematically over a 100o span of latitude on the voyage south. However, quantitative assessment of the spot numbers needs care; the number of reporters receiving spots changes with time and distance. Furthermore, there were far fewer distinct reporters for the MF and upper HF bands (11 for 160 m and 14 for 10 m compared with 447 for 40 m and 473 for 20 m). The heatmaps of SNR show several intriguing features, including steps from no decodes to SNRs some 10 dB above the WSPR decoding threshold as bands open and close. A Grafana dashboard is available for all to explore at http://logs1.wsprdaemon.org:3000/d/QGlNSz-Gk_2&nbsp; Other ways to obtain WSPR data from the WsprDaemon database are outlined, including using Octave, KNIME, R, Python, PySpark and Clickhouse. A worked example shows how to use Octave to generate a time sequence of great circle maps, as a movie, of where WSPR spots from DP0POL were received on the voyage from 27.5oN to 70.5oS.</p>},

  abstract  = {<p>The Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) is potentially a useful tool in the quantitative study of ionospheric propagation. But there are a number of factors to be considered in the use of WSPR to make propagation measurements, and it is useful to have a baseline at solar minimum to compare with measurements as we approach solar maximum in the next five years. One key measurement question is to what degree WSPR is linear, and over what dynamic range, in real-world propagation conditions. Another important issue is the role of noise in WSPR measurements. WSPR spots report SNR, not signal strength, so identification and quantification of various sources of noise is necessary. During a year of analysis of spots of my transmissions on 20 meters from a mid-latitude location (Virginia Beach), I have addressed these questions and made other observations of propagation at solar minimum. My results include:<br />
&nbsp;- a determination that WSPR spots are linear with respect to transmit power from around -25 dB SNR to over +10 dB SNR;<br />
&nbsp;- that the dynamic range may extend to more than 60 dB; however, a particular receivers dynamic range for simultaneous spots&nbsp; may be substantially less than this;<br />
&nbsp;- there is an approximately 6 dB noise fuzz measured from ground wave reception, that can be averaged out, but a cost of time resolution;<br />
&nbsp;- there is especially large variability in propagation at sunrise, sunset, and at the edge of the skip zone; on the other hand, long-distance propagation (e.g., to Hawaii or the Canary Islands) can have surprisingly low variability;<br />
&nbsp;- even with zero sunspots and low K indices, there is substantial short-term variability in propagation which I have attempted to characterize. Very small changes in the K-index can have major effects on the distance of the skip zone and on nighttime propagation.</p>

  abstract  = {<p>Measurement of Doppler shifts of high frequency (HF) radio signals emitted by precision frequency transmitters is a well-established technique for the detection of traveling ionospheric disturbances and other perturbations in the bottomside ionosphere. Because Doppler measurements require minimal instrumentation, this technique naturally lends itself to crowdsourced data collection, and purpose-built instrumentation platforms are desirable in order to maximize consistency and repeatability. However, even the best system only has value if it is used, and a robust and engaged community of citizen scientists is vital to sustaining instrumentation platforms. The Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) has developed a prototype, low-cost system for making HF Doppler shift measurements of signals from standards stations such as WWV (Fort Collins, Colorado, USA) and CHU (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). This system, known as the Personal Space Weather Station Grape Version 1, consists of a low intermediate frequency (IF) mixer board, GPS disciplined oscillator, and Raspberry Pi. In collaboration with funded project scientists and engineers, volunteer HamSCI community members developed instructions for building and operating a Grape Version 1 on the HamSCI website. In this presentation, we explain the process for constructing a Grape Version 1 and discuss the experiences of volunteers who have built and are now operating this system. We also discuss preliminary data from these stations, which show dramatic Doppler shifts during sunrise and sunset and during solar events. Concurrent data from multiple proximal stations show shared features and can be used for validation. These stations constitute the first iteration of the Personal Space Weather Station network.</p>},

  abstract  = {<p>Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) are propagating variations in ionospheric electron densities that affect radio communications and can help with understanding energy transport throughout the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-neutral atmosphere system. Large scale TIDs (LSTIDs) have periods T ≈30-180 min, horizontal phase velocities vH≈ 100- 250 m/s, and horizontal wavelengths H&gt;1000 km and are believed to be generated either by geomagnetic activity or lower atmospheric sources. TIDs create concavities in the ionospheric electron density profile that move horizontally with the TID and cause skip-distance focusing effects for high frequency (HF, 3-30 MHz) radio signals propagating through the ionosphere. The signature of this phenomena is manifest as quasi-periodic variations in contact ranges in HF amateur radio communication reports recorded by automated monitoring systems such as the Weak Signal Propagation Reporting Network (WSPRNet) and the Reverse Beacon Network (RBN). In this study, members of the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) present a climatology of LSTID activity using RBN and WSPRNet observations on the 1.8, 3.5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 MHz amateur radio bands from 2017. Results will be organized as a function observation frequency, longitudinal sector (North America and Europe), season, and geomagnetic activity level. Connections to geospace are explored via SYM-H and Auroral Electrojet indexes, while neutral atmospheric sources are explored using NASAs Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2).</p>},

  abstract  = {<p>The HamSCI community has been studying apparent frequency shifts in the reception of HF skywave signals from radio station WWV in Ft. Collins, CO. Causes for frequency shifts in the received signal are recognized as complex and varied. Leading candidates are Doppler shifts resulting from dynamic changes in refraction layer height and the behavior of modes at incidence angles at the cusp between escape into space and refraction back to earth. Observations have shown the most radical frequency disturbances occur during the diurnal transitions between night and day, with the morning transitions exhibiting more radical behavior than evening. Other changes in solar radiation such as passage of an eclipse shadow or solar flares produce similar results. In all cases the frequency swings were found to follow the rate of change of propagation path length. Specific behaviors studied include mode splitting, where the Doppler shift diverges into multiple overtone-related tracks, modes that abruptly manifest and disappear during the transition, and asymptotic behavior where Doppler tracks exhibit a rapid frequency change followed by extinction. A morning transition spectrogram showing some of these characteristics is shown in the accompanying figure. This paper describes experiments and analytical procedures devised to better understand these phenomena. They include Time-of-Flight measurements reconciled with a geometric model of the ionosphere to infer propagation modes, use of the geometric model to calculate layer height changes from measured Doppler shifts, and comparison of specific features between spectrogram and ionosonde data sets. Data from two morning transitions and the 2017 total eclipse are given. Plausible explanations for several aspects of observed frequency swings are postulated.</p>},

  abstract  = {<p>The spread in the echoes of high-frequency (HF, 3-30 MHz) radio waves from the F-region of the ionosphere was one of the earliest indications of plasma density irregularities in the mid-latitude F region ionosphere. Although mid-latitude spread F has been widely studied, the plasma instability mechanisms that create these irregularities are still largely unknown. This phenomenon can cause radio wave scintillation effects that degrade the performance of human-made technologies such as satellite communications and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Understanding these irregularities so that they can be anticipated and mitigated are important aspects of space weather research. The occurrence climatology and variability can also be helpful in validating models of these irregularities. Here, we present signatures of mid-latitude irregularities observed in oblique ionograms received near Scranton, PA transmitted by the Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar (ROTHR) in Chesapeake, Virginia. These observations are collected with the GNU Chirpsounder2 software, an open source software package capable of creating ionograms from frequency modulated (FM) chirp ionosondes. This ionospheric sounding mode will be implemented in the currently under-development Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS), a ground-based multi-instrument system designed to remote-sense the ionosphere using signals of opportunity. Using the data from the oblique ionograms, we generate the Range Time Intensity (RTI) plots that show ionospheric dynamics through measured path length variations as a function of time. We also compare the RTI plots with Range-Time-Parameter (RTP) plots from the SuperDARN HF radar in Blackstone, Virginia which commonly observes direct backscatter from decameter-scale irregularities within the region of ionosphere traversed by the ROTHR signal.</p>},

  abstract  = {<p>Amateur (ham) radio high frequency (HF) communications are routinely observed by automated receiving systems on a quasi-global scale. As these signals are modulated by the ionosphere, it is possible to use these observations to remotely sense ionospheric dynamics and the coupled geospace environment. In this presentation, we demonstrate the use of these data to observe Large Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (LSTIDs), which are quasi-periodic variations in F region electron density with horizontal wavelengths &gt; 1000 km and periods between 30 to 180 min. On 3 November 2017, LSTID signatures were detected simultaneously over the continental United States in observations made by global HF amateur radio observing networks and the Blackstone (BKS) SuperDARN radar. The amateur radio LSTIDs were observed on the 7 and 14 MHz amateur radio bands as changes in average propagation path length with time, while the LSTIDs were observed by SuperDARN as oscillations of average scatter range. LSTID period lengthened from T ~ 1.5 hr at 12 UT to T ~ 2.25 hr by 21 UT. The amateur radio and BKS SuperDARN radar observations corresponded with Global Navigation Satellite System differential Total Electron Content (GNSS dTEC) measurements. dTEC was used to estimate LSTID parameters: horizontal wavelength 1136 km, phase velocity 1280 km/hr, period 53 min, and propagation azimuth 167. The LSTID signatures were observed throughout the day following ~400 to 800 nT surges in the Auroral Electrojet (AE) index. As a contrast, 16 May 2017 was identified as a period with significant amateur radio coverage but no LSTID signatures in spite of similar geomagnetic conditions and AE activity as the 3 November event. We hypothesize that atmospheric gravity wave (AGW) sources triggered by auroral electrojet intensifications and associated Joule heating are the source of the LSTIDs, and discuss possible reasons why LSTIDs were observed in November but not May.</p>},

  abstract  = {In this paper I outline the data processing technique which is used in the SuperMAG initiative. SuperMAG is a worldwide collaboration of organizations and national agencies that currently operate more than 300 ground based magnetometers. SuperMAG provides easy access to validated ground magnetic field perturbations in the same coordinate system, identical time resolution and with a common baseline removal approach. The purpose of SuperMAG is to provide scientists, teachers, students and the general public easy access to measurements of the magnetic field at the surface of the Earth. Easy access to data, plots and derived products maximizes the utilization of this unique data set. It is outlined how SuperMAG processes the observations obtained by the individual data provider. Data are rotated into a local magnetic coordinate system by determining a time dependent declination angle. This angle displays a slow gradual change and a yearly periodic variation attributed to changes in the Earth main field and season temperature variations. The baseline is determined from the data itself in a three step process: (1) a daily baseline, (2) a yearly trend, and (3) a residual offset. This technique does not require so-called quiet days and thus it avoids all the well-known problems associated with their identification. The residual offset for the N- and Z-components shows a distinct latitudinal dependence while the E-component is independent of the latitude. This result is interpreted as being due to a weak ring current (likely asymmetric) which is present even during official quiet days. For the purpose of M-I research using 1-min data I find no difference between observatories and variometers. I finally argue that there is no correct baseline determination technique since we do not have a set of ground-truth observations required to make an objective evaluation. Instead, the user must keep in mind the assumptions on which the baseline was determined and draw conclusions accordingly. © 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

Quantitative Doppler measurements of high frequency (HF) time standard stations, used in bottom side ionospheric sensing, have been accomplished using existing radio hardware belonging to volunteers in distributed campaigns. However, typical shortwave receivers cannot be put to ordinary use while these measurements are being taken, do not have standardized signal chains, and are generally too expensive to be purchased for the sole purpose of taking Doppler measurements. Here, we provide documentation for a low-cost intermediate frequency receiver, the Grape Version 1, which is designed specifically for measurements of North American time standard stations. Grape receivers can be easily constructed and deployed by amateur scientists in order to gain a deeper understanding of variations in radio propagation in their local environment. When compared over long periods and across distributed networks of stations, the resulting data yield insights on greater spatial and time scales. At the time of writing, several of these receivers have been deployed across the United States and are actively collecting data. These receivers form the first iteration of the Low-Cost Personal Space Weather Station network.</p>},

We incorporated the updated index into the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model and compared the foF2 model predictions with global ionospheric observations. We also investigated the influence of the underlying foF2 model on the IG index. IRI has two options for foF2 specification, the CCIR-66 and URSI-88 foF2 models. For the first time, we have calculated IG using URSI-88 and assessed the impact on model predictions. Through a retrospective model-data comparison, results show that the inclusion of the new monthly IGNS index in place of the current 12-month smoothed IG index reduce the foF2 model prediction errors by nearly a factor of two. These results apply to both day-time and nightime predictions. This is due to an overall improved prediction of foF2 seasonal and solar cycle variations in the different hemispheres.},
